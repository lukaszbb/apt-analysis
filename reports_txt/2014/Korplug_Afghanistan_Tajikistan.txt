Korplug military targeted attacks: Afghanistan & Tajikistan

After taking a look at recent Korplug (PlugX) detections, we identified two larger scale campaigns
employing this well-known Remote Access Trojan. This blog gives an overview of the first one, related to
Afghanistan & Tajikistan. The other campaign, where the targets were a number of high-profile
organizations in Russia, will be the subject of Anton Cherepanov’s presentation at the ZeroNights
security conference in Moscow this week.

Sometimes malware used in various attacks is unique enough to identify related incidents, which makes
tracking individual botnets simpler. An example is the BlackEnergy Lite variant (also known as
BlackEnergy 3) used by a group of attackers (that was then given the name Quedagh, or Sandworm)
against targets in Ukraine and other countries. BlackEnergy Lite is clearly distinguishable from the
numerous binaries of the more common BlackEnergy 2 also circulating in-the-wild.

In other cases, attackers use more common tools for accomplishing their criminal goals. For example, the
Korplug RAT (a.k.a .PlugX) is a well-known toolkit associated with Chinese APT groups and used in a
large number of targeted attacks since 2012. For the past several weeks we have taken a closer look at a
great number of detections of this malware in many unrelated incidents.

Among these, we were able to discover several successful infections where the employed Korplug samples

were connecting to the same C&C domain.

Taking these C&Cs as a starting point, we were able to locate a number of victims infected through various
exploit-laden spear-phishing documents and cunningly-named archives.

Some of the above-mentioned files also contained decoy documents:

In all of the cases, three binary files were dropped (apart from decoy documents) that led to the Korplug
trojan being loading into memory.

exe – a legitimate executable with a Kaspersky digital signature that would load a DLL with a
specific file name

dll – a small DLL loader that would pass execution to the Korplug raw binary code
dll.avp – raw Korplug binary

The Korplug RAT is known to use this side-loading trick by abusing legitimate digitally signed executables
and is a way to stay under the radar, since a trusted application with a valid signature among startup items
is less likely to raise suspicion.

The maliciously crafted documents are RTF files that successfully exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability
in Microsoft Word. The image below shows the beginning of the CVE-2012-0158 shellcode in ASCII
encoding within the document (the opcodes 60, 55, 8bec disassemble to pusha; push ebp; mov ebp, esp).

Interestingly, though, the documents also contain the newer CVE-2014-1761 exploit that was extensively
used in targeted attacks carried out by a number other malware families this year (including BlackEnergy,
Sednit, MiniDuke, and others). However, this exploit is not implemented correctly due to a wrong file
offset in the 1st stage shellcode.

Below we see the disassembly of the 1st stage shellcode where it checks the presence of the tag “p!11”
marking the beginning of the 2nd stage shellcode and loads it into memory. Even though the tag and 2nd
stage shellcode is present in the RTF, it’s at a different offset, and thus never is loaded.

Sophos’ Gabor Szappanos gives a possible explanation how these malformed samples may have come into

existence.

ESET LiveGrid telemetry indicates that the attacks against these targets have been going on since at least
June 2014 and continue through today.

We were able to pinpoint the targets to residents of the following countries:

Afghanistan
Tajikistan
Russia
Kyrgyzstan
Kazakhstan

From the topics of the files used to spread the malware, as well as from the affected targets, it appears that
the attackers are interested in gathering intelligence related to Afghan, Tajik and Russian military and
diplomatic subjects.

Interestingly, most of the affected victims have another thing in common – a number of other RATs, file
stealing trojans or keyloggers were detected on their systems on top of the Korplug RAT detection. One of
these ‘alternative RATs’ was connecting to a domain also used by the Korplug samples.

Since the functionality of these tools was partly overlapping with that of Korplug, it left us wondering
whether the attackers were just experimenting with different RATs or were they supplementing some
functionality that they were unable to accomplish.

Additional information about two malware families that were most often found accompanying Korplug
infections is given below.

Alternative Malware #1: DarkStRat

A curious Remote Access Trojan, as research points to a Chinese connection but the commands it listens
to are in Spanish (translation in English):

CERRAR (close)
DESINSTALAR (uninstall)
SERVIDOR (server)
INFO
MAININFO
PING
REBOOT

POWEROFF
PROC
KILLPROC
VERUNIDADES (see units)
LISTARARCHIVOS (list files)
EXEC
DELFILE
DELFOLDER
RENAME
MKDIR
CAMBIOID (change ID)
GETFILE/SENDFILE/RESUMETRANSFER
SHELL
SERVICIOSLISTAR (list service)
INICIARSERVICIO (start service)
DETENERSERVICIO (stop service)
BORRARSERVICIO (erase service)
INSTALARSERVICIO (install service)

The malware can manage processes and services on the infected machine, transfer files to and from the
C&C server, run shell commands, and so on. It is written in Delphi and connects to
www.dicemention.com. Some samples contain a digital signature by “Nanning weiwu Technology co.,ltd”.

Alternative Malware #2: File Stealer

This malware, written in C, and contains several functions for harvesting files off the victim’s hard drive
according to criteria set in the configuration file. Apart from doing a recursive sweep of all logical fixed
and remote drives, it also continually monitors any attached removable media or network shares by
listening to DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL events.

In addition to collecting files, the malware attempts to gather saved passwords, history of visited URLs,
account information and proxy information from the following applications:

Microsoft Messenger
Microsoft Outlook
Microsoft Internet Explorer
Mozilla Firefox

The C&C domains used by this malware are:

newvinta.com
worksware.net

Some samples of this file stealer detected in these campaigns also contain the signature by “Nanning
weiwu Technology co.,ltd” – another indicator that the infections are related.
