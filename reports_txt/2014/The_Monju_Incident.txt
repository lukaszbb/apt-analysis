1 Distribution 

Context Information Security distribute Context Threat Intelligence (CTI) reporting under 
the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)[1], a method of classifying a document in order to promote 
the distribution of sensitive information between individuals, organisations or 
communities in a controlled and trusted way, based on the originator’s wishes. 

The various levels of the TLP are represented by the following colours: 

RED - Personal; for named recipients only 

Sources may use TLP: RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon by 
additional parties, and could lead to impacts on a party's privacy, reputation, or 
operations if misused. 

 

Recipients may not share TLP: RED information with any parties outside of the specific 
exchange, meeting, or conversation in which it is originally disclosed.  TLP: RED 
information will be passed verbally or in person. 

AMBER - Limited Distribution 

Sources may use TLP: AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted 
upon, but carries risks to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the 
organisations involved. 

Recipients may only share TLP: AMBER information with members of their own 
organisation who need to know, and only as widely as necessary to act on that 
information. 

GREEN – Community Wide 

Sources may use TLP: GREEN when information is useful for the awareness of all 
participating organisations as well as with peers within the broader community or sector. 

Recipients may share TLP: GREEN information with peers and partner organisations within 
their sector or community, but not via publicly accessible channels such as publication 
or posting publicly on the Internet.

2 Executive Summary 

On 2nd January 2014 a Systems Administrator at the Monju fast breeder reactor facility in 
Japan noticed suspicious connections emanating from a machine in the control room, 
coinciding with what was a seemingly routine software update to a free media player. 
Among other items, staff training documents and more than 40,000 emails were stored 
on the machine and thought to be harvested by the attacker. The Japanese Atomic 
Energy Agency is investigating further. 

The attack appears to have been the result of the attackers having compromised the 
‘GOM Player’ update server and having it act as a ‘watering hole’, meaning that 
machines which access the site are delivered malware.  Gom Player originates in South 
Korea and in some parts of Asia it is a popular alternative to Windows Media Player. It is 
unclear whether every machine trying to download an update received this malware or 
whether only machines which fitted a certain profile were infected. 

Technical analysis of the implant on the compromised machine has shown it to be a 
variant of a Trojan which has been in the wild for some years now and continues to be 
effective. The ‘Gh0st RAT’ has been used extensively in attacks linked to the Chinese 
state, though it is important to remember that the code is publicly available and can be 
modified and used by anyone. The targeting of a Japanese nuclear facility however, is 
consistent with Chinese state intelligence requirements. If this is the work of a Chinese 
group then we feel the targeting may go much further than the Civil Nuclear sector and 
thus be of interest to the wider Energy Sector and industry as a whole. 

In order to inform the Energy Sector and beyond about this attack, we have compiled a 
technical summary of the attack and have provided a number of Indicators Of 
Compromise (IOCs) which can be used to aid detection.  It is likely that the attackers 
would redeploy their implant against other targets, albeit with a delivery mechanism 
more tailored to the location of the intended victims.

3 The Monju Incident 

3.1 Infection Vector 

Based on open source reporting, it appears that the intrusion took place via the 
compromise of the GOM Player update server (app.gomlab.com), where attackers 
may have gained entry via a PHP-based webshell, hidden within an image, present on 
the host since October 2011[2]. 

The observed malicious activity relates to the modification of a file that controls GOM 
Player updates, spanning the date range 27th December 2013 to 16th January 2014, 
during which time these alterations are reported to have only manifested themselves for 
visitors on certain IP ranges; evidence supporting this claim has not yet been made 
public.  If this was indeed the case, then the nature of this attack is certainly more 
targeted than one that would cover the entire userbase of the GOM Player product, 
with victims comprising of the Japanese Government in addition to those at the Monju 
nuclear facility. 

The modified file redirected the GOM Player update process to another compromised 
server (www.fudousankaitori.jp (203.189.101.35)), where a file containing both the 
legitimate update and the malware was deliver to the victim.

3.2 Malware 

3.2.1 Overview 

Deployed to the system via a compressed bundle containing the official GOM Player 
setup binary and a self-extracting RAR archive containing the malicious files, the 
malware consists of a number of individual pieces.  Upon extraction from the RAR 
archive, the installer component (0ae82fd94836815a1e8d284ccb75109d) is 

automatically launched alongside the GOM Player update, distracting victims from the 
malicious activity taking place. 

The installer component is referred to by the author as ‘miansha' which, according to an 
East Asia Cyber Threat Intelligence Researcher, is likely Miǎnshā (免杀), a phrase 

commonly used by People’s Republic of China (PRC) hackers to mean ‘anti Antivirus 
detection’ or ‘Antivirus avoidance’; Symantec[3] have named the detection for this 
code ‘Backdoor.Miancha’, where Miǎnchá (免查, likely shorthand for 免杀查) similarly 

means ‘Antivirus avoidance’.  The installer is responsible for the malware persistence 
mechanism, adding entries to the registry in the following locations, depending on 
Windows Version: 

Miancha Persistence Registry Keys 

Windows Vista and later 

HKEY_USERS\.default\Software\Classes\CLSID\{ECD4FC4D-
5213-11D0-B792-00A0C90312E1}\InProcServer32\@ = 
expand:"C:\WINDOWS\temp\install.ocx" 

Prior to Windows Vista 

HKEY_USERS\.default\Software\Classes\CLSID\{B12AE898-
D056-4378-A844-6D393FE37956}\InProcServer32\@ = 
expand:"C:\WINDOWS\temp\install.ocx" 

The installer will also determine the system architecture (32- or 64-bit) and then 
deobfuscate the relevant loader DLL to the path ‘C:\Windows\temp\install.ocx’, 
ensuring the malware is launched on system start-up.  Oddly, this file is padded with null 
bytes, resulting in a 25 megabyte file.

The main implant code is stored in files named instructions.pdf and instructions64.pdf; 
not PDF documents but instead DLLs obfuscated with a one-byte XOR with 0x14, similar 
to the malware loader DLLs.  The loader, referred to by the malware author as 壳 (shell), 

reads and deobfuscates the main implant code which then communicates with the 
attacker-controlled server at testqweasd.tk (211.43.220.89) on TCP port 443.  The main 
implant code is referred to as 白加黑 (‘Black on White’), a term used in the PRC hacking 

community to denote the act of Antivirus avoidance through the loading of malicious 
‘black’ code via non-malicious or trusted ‘white‘ code.  This is a practice recently 
illustrated through the deployment of the PlugX trojan, utilising DLL load order hijacking 
alongside a signed (trusted) executable.  

Analysis of this malware revealed it to be a variant of the Gh0st RAT, often used by 
Chinese actors (including those who are state-motivated or directly state-sponsored).  
This specific variant shows similarities to that used during the VOHO campaign[4], where 
Gh0st RAT was spread via watering hole attacks utilising vulnerable websites belonging 
to financial services and technology companies.  Specifically, the initial five bytes of the 
communications (often used to denote a campaign or victim) are ‘HTTPS’, amended 
from the original ‘Gh0st’; the same as the traffic produced by the VOHO Gh0st variant. 

In addition to delivering system-specific details back to the attacker, Gh0st RAT provides 
the capability to deploy additional malware, enabling the harvesting of sensitive data 
and enabling the further propagation throughout the infected network.

3.2.2 Detection 

To enable rapid response, the following Snort signature can be deployed: 

alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 53,80,443,1080 (msg:"gh0st RAT 'HTTPS' variant 
(aka Backdoor.Miancha)"; flow:established,to_server; content:"HTTPS"; depth:5; rawbytes; 
classtype:trojan-activity; sid:xxx; rev:1;) 

Additionally, the following Yara signature should identify both encoded payloads and 
the active implant in memory:
