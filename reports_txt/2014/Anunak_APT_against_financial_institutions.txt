execuTive summAry

This report describes the details and type of op-

erations carried out by an organized criminal group 
that focuses on financial industry, such as banks and 
payment providers, retail industry and news, media 
and PR companies. The group has its origin in more 
common financial fraud including theft from con-
sumer and corporate bank accounts in Europe and 
Russia, using standard banking malware, mainly 
Carberp.

After the arrests of Carberp group members in 

Russia, some of the members were out of work, 
however, their experience gained from many years 
of crime has allowed them to enter a new niche. One 
of the members quickly realized that they can steal 
$2000 a thousand times, and earn $2 million, but 
also they can steal it in one time and immediately 
get it with much less effort. The anti-fraud measures 
employed by banks has pushed the criminals to 
search for new ways to make money with less bar-
riers, compromising and modifying or taking data 
from banks, payment providers, retail and media/
PR companies are some of these methods.

From 2013 an organized criminal group intensi-
fied its activity focused on banks and electronic pay-
ment systems in Russia and in the post-Soviet space. 

2

The key is that fraud occurs within the corporate 
network using internal payment gateways and in-
ternal banking systems. Thus money is stolen from 
the banks and payment systems, and not from their 
customers. While this is their main and most lucra-
tive activity, the gang has also ventured into other 
areas including the compromise of media groups 
and other organizations for industrial espionage and 
likely a trading advantage on the stock market. In 
cases where the group got access to the government 
agency networks their aim was espionage related.

The organized criminal group backbone are 

citizens of both Russian and Ukrainian origin, but 
the group also sources a number of mainstream and 
specialized services from individuals and groups 
originating from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

The average sum of theft in the Russian terri-

tory and in the post-Soviet space is $2 million per 
incident. Since 2013 they have successfully gained 
access to networks of more than 50 Russian banks 
and 5 payment systems, and 2 of these institutions 
were deprived of their banking license. To date the 
total amount of theft is over 1 billion rubles (about 
25 million dollars), most of it has been stolen in the 
second half of 2014.

The average time from the moment of penetration 

into the financial institutions internal network till 
successful theft is 42 days.

As a result of access to internal bank networks 
the attackers also managed to gain access to ATM 
management infrastructure and infect those sys-
tems with their own malicious software that further 
allows theft from the banks ATM systems on the 
attackers command.

Since 2014 the organized criminal group mem-

bers began actively taking an interest in US and Eu-
ropean based retail organizations. While they were 
already familiar with POS malware and compromis-
ing POS terminals, the widespread media attention 
around the Target breach and other related breaches 
were the reason for this move. While the scale of 
breaches in this industry is still relatively low, with 
at least 3 successful card breaches and over a dozen 
retailers compromised this activity is quickly becom-
ing a lucrative endeavor for this group.

To penetrate into the internal networks this 

organized criminal group employs targeted emailing 
(spear phishing) and infections sources from other 
botnets. This is the main reason why the group is 

keeping in touch with owners of large botnets. Since 
August 2014 the group began to create their own 
large botnet using a mass emailing, but not using 
typical exploit driveby infections. This last move is 
likely to reduce the need for external contacts.

AT TAcks in russiA

The first successful bank robbery was committed 
by this group in January 2013. In all first cases the 
attackers used the program RDPdoor for remote 
access to the bank network and the program “MBR 
Eraser” to remove traces and to crack Windows 
computers and servers. Both programs were used by 
the members of the Carberp criminal group under 
the guidance of a person named Germes. To reduce 
the risk of losing access to the internal bank network 
the attackers, in addition to malicious programs, 
were also used for remote access legitimate pro-
grams such as Ammy Admin and Team Viewer. Lat-
er the attackers completely abandoned from usage 
of RDPdoor and Team Viewer.

In addition to banking and payment systems, 
hackers got access to e-mail servers to control all 
internal communications. This approach allowed 
them to find out that the anomalous activity in the 
bank network was identified, what technique was 
used to identify this activity and what measures the 
bank employees took to solve the problem. Email 
control was successfully installed regardless of used 
email system, MS Exchange or Lotus. This approach 
allowed them to take countermeasures that created 
for bank and payment system employees the feeling 
that the problem had been solved.

The main steps of the attack progression are the 

following ones:

1.  Primary infection of an ordinary employee 

computer.

2.  Getting a password of a user with administra-
tive rights on some computers. For example, a 
password of a technical support engineer. 

3.  Gaining legitimate access to one server.

4.  Compromising the domain administrator 

password from the server.

5.  Gaining access to the domain controller and 
compromising of all active domain accounts.

3

6.  Gaining access to e-mail and workflow servers.

7.  Gaining access to server and banking system 

administrator workstations.

8.  Installing the software to monitor activity of 
interesting system operators. Usually photo 
and video recording was used.

9.  Configuring remote access to servers of inter-
est including firewall configuration changes.

Tools for aT Tack

To carry out target attacks in 2014 the hackers 
have finalized development of their core malware 
Anunak that is used along with the following tools:

Program

Mimikatz

MBr Eraser
softPerfect 
Network scanner
cain & abel

ssHD backdoor

ammy admin

Team Viewer

Purpose of use
to get passwords from local and 
domain accounts

According to our laboratory classification the 

main malware is “Anunak”. This trojan is used for 
target attacks only, mainly on banks and payment 
systems. Target usage of this program allows it to 
remain poorly explored, providing it a good surviv-
ability inside corporate networks. The source code of 
the bank trojan program Carberp was used in some 
places of this malware. “Anunak” has the following 
feature set:

•  The software called “Mimikatz” is built in this 

program. This is an open source software that al-
lows to obtain passwords of user accounts logged 
in the Windows system. However, this software 
was considerably changed: while maintaining the 
capability to get account passwords the functions 
of user interaction and of information output for 
errors and program execution were eliminated. 
Thus, when the malicious program is executed 
on the server, it will secretly compromise all the 

attacker gets remote access to the user computer 
with the running program “AmmyAdmin” bypassing 
firewalls. The window screenshot is shown in the 
figure below: 

When the attackers gain access to servers running 
operating systems of the Linux family they use SSH 
backdoor that transmits to the malicious server the 
login/password data used to access the servers and 
provides attackers remote access to the servers.

To provide access to the server of interest the at-
tackers may appropriately modify rules for firewalls 
Microsoft TMG, CISCO, etc.

When the attackers yet had no major malware 
that would secretly install the program “AmmyAd-
min” and report to the attackers a remote access 
password, they used a malicious program known 
as “Barus”. This malware is used rarely and the last 
time we met it in 2013. This malicious program is 
developed by Russian-speaking authors. In the 
control panel you can notice a field “Ammy ID”, its 
usage allowed the attackers to connect remotely.

domain and local accounts, including adminis-
trator accounts. To get account passwords it is 
sufficient to enter two commands in succession: 
“privilege::debug” and “sekurlsa::logonpass-
words”. When this program is executed on a 
domain controller or an e-mail server it compro-
mises virtually all the domain accounts, includ-
ing administrators.

•  There is also the possibility to add a file into the 
firewall exclusion list by creating the correspond-
ing rule with the utility “Netsh”.

•  The functions of keypress grabber as well as the 
function of screenshot creation are implemented 
in the program.

•  There are also the functions to interact with the 

bank system iFOBS.

•  The malware sends key information, screenshots 

and CAB-archives to its management server.

•  The program is able to secretly make changes to 
a number of system files, presumably to remove 
the limitations of Microsoft Windows desktop 
operating systems on the number of users that 
may simultaneously connect to the correspond-
ing PC using RDP to administer it remotely.

There is the ability to download arbitrary exe-

cutable files from the management server and run 
them. One of these files is the program “AmmyAd-
min” that may be run with the arguments “-service” 
and “-nogui” that force it to start as a service without 
user interface. “AmmyAdmin” allows to connect 
with another computer that has the same software 
through the server “rl.ammyy.com” using the IP 
address and the unique identifier. As a result, the

At the very beginning of their activity in 2013 due 

to lack of the target Trojan the attackers began to 
distribute Andromeda and Pony. They distributed 
these malware using Driveby through a bunch of 
Neutrino Exploit Kit exploits as shown in the figure 
below. It is interesting that in the autumn 2013 they 
used the site http://php.net/ as traffic source to 
Magnitude EK. They redirected the traffic from this 
resource since July 2013, but this fact was discov-
ered much later. The name of one of the streams to 
distribute the malware is “LOL BANK FUCKIUNG” 
that corresponded to the attacker activities.

Parallel to this technique they also use another 
infection method, which was one of the principal 
methods. The main method of distribution is send-
ing emails with malicious attachments on behalf of 
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, a poten-
tial client or an real counterparty (at first the attack-
ers had cracked this counterparty account, then they 
used emailing with the cracked contact list).

Another used method is to install a special 

malware to carry out targeted attacks via another 
malware that might appear in the local network 
by accident. To find such malicious programs the 
criminal group keeps in touch with several owners of 
large botnets that massively distributes their mal-

ware. The attackers buy from these botnet owners 
the information about IP-addresses of computers 
where the botnet owners have installed malware and 
then check whether the IP-address belongs to the 
financial and government institutions. If the mal-
ware is in the subnet of interest, the attackers pay 
the large botnet owner for installation of their target 
malware. Such partner relations were established 
with owners of botnets Zeus, Shiz Ranbyus. All of 
these trojans are bank Trojans, their usage is ex-
plained by the previously established relationships. 
In late 2013 the hacker under the alias Dinhold be-
gan to build his own botnet using modified Carberp, 
having uploaded its source code for public access. 
The attackers were trying to create similar relations 
with this hacker, but in 2014 he was arrested, having 
not developed his botnet up to the required level.

To check whether the IP-address belongs to the 

desired network the following script is used:

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os
from bulkwhois.shadowserver import BulkWhoisshadow-

server

iplist_file = ‘ip.txt’
path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
bulk_whois = BulkWhoisshadowserver()
iplist = []
with open(os.path.join(path, iplist_file)) as f:
   for line in f:

5

       iplist.append(line.strip())
result = bulk_whois.lookup_ip-

s(iplist)

with open(os.path.join(path, ‘data.

txt’), ‘a’) as f:

   for record in result:
       f.write(‘IP: %s\
cc: %s\
org. Name: %s\
register: %s\
as Name: %s\
BGP Prefix: %s\

‘ % (result[record][‘ip’], result[re-

cord][‘cc’], result[record][‘org_
name’], result[record][‘register’], 
result[record][‘as_name’], result[re-
cord][‘bgp_prefix’]))

The most dangerous emailings 
are those that are sent on behalf 
of partners with whom financial 
and government institutions 
communicates permanently 
by email. An example of such 
emailing occurred on Septem-
ber 25, 2014, at 14:11, from the 
e-mail address “Elina Shchekina 
<e.shekina@rbkmoney.com>” 
with the subject “Updated agree-
ment version”. The attachment 
“agreement.doc” exploits the vul-
nerability CVE-2012-2539 and 
CVE-2012-0158. The emailing 

6

was conducted for more than 
70 addresses of various compa-
nies (where multiple recipient 
addresses may be within one 
company). 

The letter with malicious 
attachment (md5: AA36BA9F-
4DE5892F1DD427B7B2100B06) 
in the archive with a password 
from a potential client was sent 
to a bank manager after a pre-
liminary telephone conversation 
with him. The call origin is Saint 
Petersburg.

Availability of access to bank internal networks 
opens great opportunities for the hackers. One of 
these opportunities is access to ATMs from spe-
cial network segments that had to be isolated. It is 
confirmed that this criminal group gained access to 
52 ATMs. The amount of damage exceeds 50 million 
rubles. As a result of access to ATMs, depending on 
the ATM model, hackers used different patterns.

Having access, the attackers downloaded mali-

cious scripts and changed denominations of issued 
banknotes in the ATM operating system registry. As 
a result, for query to get 10 notes with denomination 
of 100 roubles the attackers received 10 banknotes 
with denomination of 5,000 roubles. The used 
malicious script and program were developed for the 
platform Wincor.

As a result of this file execution the registry key that

program that allows by the command to issue mon-
ey from the dispenser. The original debug program 
issues money through the dispenser only when the 
open ATM housing and the vault door are fixed. 

In order to ensure money issuance from the 

closed ATM the attackers had to modify the 
original program “KDIAG32” (the original file: 
size of 1,128,960 MD5 4CC1A6E049942EB-

SSHD backdoor was installed 
on Unix servers and, In addi-
tion, it was loaded from the 
same hacked server as in other 
cases of trojan Anunak usage. 
However, in this case Androm-
eda is used as the main trojan 
instead of Anunak. The man-
agement servers were located 
in Kazakhstan, Germany and 
Ukraine. Check of the manage-
ment servers showed that it was 
the hosting Bulletproof that, in 
addition to servers, provides 
a service of traffic proxying 
through its infrastructure as 
well as TOR and VPN usage, 
so this pattern is significantly 
differs from the Anunak host-
ing patern. Check of money cashout showed 
that the same cashout criminal group had worked 
as for Anunak and this fact again confirmed their 
cooperation.

Obtained Andromeda trojan copies were being 
distributed from August 2014 by e-mail. The value 
754037e7be8f61cbb1b85ab46c7da77d, which is the 
MD5 hash of the string “go fuck yourself”, was used 
as the RC4 encryption key. As a result of this distri-
bution from August to late October the Andromeda 
botnet rose up to 260,000 bots. Successful infection 
in one subnet resulted in sending such letters to 
other bank employees. Example of forwarding from 
an infected bank network to employees of another 
bank is shown below. 

As a result of this radial mailing many oil and gas 
companies, banks and government agencies were in-
fected. In Russia at least 15 banks and two payment 
systems were infected this way. 

Letters with similar attachments were being dis-

tributed with the following subjects:

Previously, it should be noted the fact that the 
process of stolen money withdrawal (cashout) was 
differed, firstly by the theft method, secondly by the 

10

victim type (a bank or a payment system), thirdly by 
the total stolen sum. 

The victims by their type were divided rather by 
counterparty types and by limitations imposed by 
operation with the counterparties. For example, all 
payments were required to go through a certain pool 
of mediators. In addition, the “improper” pool of 
counterparties could cause suspicion and unneces-
sary testing (manual processing of payment orders).

Bank (amounts up to 100 million roubles):

•  When the attackers had obtained control of a 
bank operator workstation (attacker purpose), 
they in general used a classic tree scheme when 
funds from the bank account were sent to several 
legal entities, then from each legal entity to 
smaller legal entities (may be several such iter-
ations) and then to private person credit cards 
(from 600 to 7000 transactions).

•  When the attackers had obtained control of ATM 
management service (attacker purpose), money 
were withdrawn directly from the ATM by the at-
tacker command. In this case the whole cashout 
process consisted in that a drop person had to be 
near the ATM at the specified time with a bag to 
empty the dispenser.
Bank (amounts from 100 million roubles):

•  Money was sent to accounts of other banks, and 
cracked banks were often used where accounts 
and credit cards had been prepared in advance.
Payment system:
In addition to all the above methods, cash 
sending channels were also employed through 
the settlements systems, electronic wallets and 
payment systems, such as web money, Yandex 

• 

Money, QIWI (1500-2000 transactions). Reve-
nues of large amounts (up to 50 million roubles) 
were recorded to particular cards of private per-
sons who then used these cards to buy expensive 
small-sized goods such as jewelry, watches, and 
other attributes. A huge part of the money was 
sent through mobile operators (1500-2000 SIM 
cards prepared in advance).
In spring 2014 (high time of this fraud type) 2 
cashout person groups were known who support-
ed target attacks, by autumn 2014 their number 

• 

increased to 5. In general, this increase was due 
to number of thefts too (number of victims + 
average stolen sum per 1 victim). The groups 
are working in different cities to ensure better 
cashout distribution. Also these groups include 
immigrants from former Soviet republics who if 
necessary arrive in the required city. Each group 
was monitored by a separate person. Each group 
consists of about 15-20 people.

•  Part of the money was transferred to Ukraine and 

Belarus.

While the attacks in Russia against banks and 
payment systems have occurred over the past two 
years, the attacks against the retail industry is only 
something which started in the second quarter of 
2014. With at least three confirmed breaches where 
card track data was obtainedand a total of at least 16 
breaches at retail organizations, it is also becoming a 
serious threat.

Apart from retail organizations it is also known 

that a number of media and PR companies have 
been breached in 2014. While it is not entirely cer-
tain, the type of breaches suggest that the attackers 
are looking for inside information, a type of indus-
trial espionage, allowing them to gain an advantage 
on the stock market. As there is nothing specifically 
missing and the resulting fraud is hard to match 
with anything, these incidents typically are never 
linked.

Table: Overview of compromises per region and 

sector.

i n f e c t i o n  m e t h o d s 

From the retail perspective, the first infections in 

2014 were sourced from a botnet which employs a 
widely deployed crypto-currency mining malware 
based on the Gozi/ISFB (banking) malware family. 
Based on our insights we believe during the first 
half of 2014 over half a million systems had been 
compromised by this malware from over the whole 
world, however Russia and a number of post-Soviet 
states were clean of infections. To find interesting 
infections within this large set of compromised 
systems, the malware extracts relevant information 
from the systems including Microsoft Windows 
organization registration information and network/
Windows domain information.

The Gozi/ISFB based malware was used to drop 

additional components on interesting systems, 
which included Metasploit/Meterpreter payloads 

and Anunak variants. This was one of the main 
methods for the group using Anunak to obtain in-
teresting infections in the middle of 2014, sourcing 
infections from other botnet operators.More recent-
ly other infection methods, including spear phishing 
using English language and possibly also usage of 
the teams own Andromeda, but also SQL injection 
to breach an organization directly from the outside, 
has been employed by this team.

p o s  c o m p r o m i s e s

The first known attacks with Anunak targeted 
a specific brand of POS systems which revolved 
around the Epicor/NSB brand. To do this Anunak 
has specific code to target POS devices equipped 
with this software, which in contrary to the more 
common memory scanning track data scrapers, logs 
a wealth of information from the payments done by 
the cards. The first case this was seen active was in 
July 2014, but it might have been earlier as well.
More recent breaches have used a new custom 
developed POS malware, which is a more simple 
but reliable track data memory scraper. The initial 
version from the early fall of 2014 used a simple 
blacklist, scraped every process and dumped track 
data in plain text. More recent versions scanned 
only configuration specified processes and used RC4 
to encrypt the extracted track data records on disk.

a d d i t i o n a l  ta r g e t s

While the retail industry is one of its main targets 

due to its payment processing capabilities, other 
compromises might occur indirectly, for example to 
obtain databases with information or other informa-
tion that is of value to the organized criminal group. 
One of the possibilities is obtaining lists of corporate 
email addresses to have a higher chance of interest-
ing infections.

At this moment we have no evidence of successful 
compromise or theft of banks and payment systems 
outside of Russia, but several infections in the east 
of Europe (specifically Ukraine and Latvia) were 
active in 2014. These specific infections were related 
to infrastructure of organizations based in Russia or 
with significant interests in Russia, thus more likely 
related to the breaches at the same organization in 
Russia.

The majority of infections from Europe were from 
dedicated servers used as exit node for VPN services, 

13

the systems infected were likely from Eastern Euro-
pean or Russian origin, and possibly test infections 
from the attackers. We have no evidence of compro-
mises against banks in Western Europe or United 
States, but it should be noted that the attackers 
methods could be utilized against banks outside of 
Russia as well.

The group uses Metasploit as one of their main 

hacking tools, either stand alone or as part of a 
framework. The activity includes port scanning and 
system reconnaissance, escalating privileges on 
systems by using for example the recent CVE-2014-
4113 vulnerability, gathering credentials and hop-
ping on to other systems and networks. Metasploit 
is being used to its full potential with scanning, 
exploiting, privilege escalation and post exploitation 
persistence being achieved with its standard toolset.

On interesting and critical systems typical hack-

ing tools might be found to establish tunnels out 
of the network, either tools that are part of the 
Metasploit framework such as Meterpreter, but also 
other tools to achieve persistence on those systems. 
The connect back methods seen are typically SSL 
over port 443, but also DNS based methods were 
observed. The attackers use BITS to download files, 
but also make use of Windows built-in PowerShell to 
download tools and execute commands. Finally on 
the critical systems freshly crypted and non-detected 
versions of Anunak are deployed, typically these are 
used in very limited deployments thus their spread 
is limited and detection by Anti-Virus is very rare.

Various stealth methods including the aforemen-

tioned backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for 
compromise persistence and data exfiltration are 
used. The Anunak malware has multiple ways of 
connecting to backends, which includes a PHP based 
backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS, and a 
Windows server based component using a propri-
etary protocol.

The use of VNC scanning and password brute 
forcing, the adding of additional administrator 
accounts, use of RDP Wrapper to allow concurrent 
RDP sessions are all methods to gain access and 
achieve persistent access to compromised systems 
employed by this group. Additionally various ways 
of creating incidental and regular screen captures 
of the desktop of persons of interest within com-

promised organizations were methods employed by 
these attackers. This also includes video captures 
made by the Anunak malware, allowing attackers to 
observe the behavior of users of certain applications.
