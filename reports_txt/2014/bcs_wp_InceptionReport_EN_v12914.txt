Executive summary 
 
Blue Coat researchers have uncovered a previously-undocumented, highly 
automated, and extremely sophisticated framework for performing targeted 
attacks. The framework is notable for a number of reasons, including (but not 
limited to) its use of a cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control and its 
use of the WebDAV protocol to send instructions and receive exfiltrated 
information from compromised systems. 
 
Initial malware components were embedded in Rich Text Format (RTF) files. 
Exploitation of vulnerabilities in this file format is leveraged to gain remote access 
to victim’s computers. 
 
The framework, thus far, has been using the services of a cloud service provider 
based in Sweden, CloudMe.com, for its main command-and-control 
infrastructure. Malware payloads designed for a wide array of potential devices, 
including home routers and mobile devices running iOS, BlackBerryOS or 
Android, were also recovered during the course of our research.  
 
The framework is designed in such a way that all post-infection communication 
(i.e. target surveying, configuration updates, malware updates, and data 
exfiltration) can be performed via the cloud service. The malware components of 
this framework follow a plugin model, where new malware rely on other, 
previously delivered malware components to interact with the framework. 
 
Initial attacks were largely focused on Russia and a few other Eastern European 
countries. However, we have later seen that attackers are interested in targets all 
over the globe.  
 
The framework is itself target-agnostic, and seems highly automated. 
 
The operational security exhibited by the attackers is very good - among the best 
we have seen. Most interaction between attackers and their infrastructure is 
performed via a convoluted network of router proxies and rented hosts. 
 
Although the attackers have left a few clues, we have been unable to provide 
attribution with any degree of accuracy.

Introduction 
 
The use of software vulnerabilities in order to execute malicious software on 
unsuspecting users’ computers is an important parameter to monitor. This 
method of attack is not only known to have a considerable success rate, it is also 
often deployed by resourceful attackers and, as such, marks a threat worth 
paying attention to. 
 
The use of exploits in document formats like PDF, DOC and RTF is in some 
ways especially noteworthy. Documents are commonly exchanged via mail, 
which make them perfect for email-borne targeted attacks; what is otherwise 
known as spear phishing. 
 
In March, 2014, Microsoft published information about a new vulnerability in Rich 
Text Format (RTF). This vulnerability, named CVE-2014-1761 (Microsoft Word 
RTF Object Confusion), had already been used effectively by attackers at the 
time of the announcement. Two previous vulnerabilities in the RTF file format, 
known as CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158, had become, by that time, 
mainstays of targeted attacks, so we tracked how attackers implemented this 
new exploit with keen interest. 
 
By late August, we identified a malware espionage operation that used both the 
CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158 vulnerabilities to trigger execution of the 
malicious payload, and which leveraged a single cloud service as the backbone 
of its entire visible infrastructure. 
 
When we examined the suspicious documents, it was discovered that they were 
somewhat anomalous compared to the run-of-the-mill material. They turned out 
to belong to a highly advanced and professional targeted attack framework, 
which utilized a complex series of techniques to survey potential targets.   
 
Due to the many levels of obfuscation and indirection, we named this the 
Inception framework; but there ends all similarity with the movie by the same 
name. Leonardo DiCaprio is not associated with this investigation.

Use of trojanized documents 
 
We initially knew little about who the actual targets were; apart from one.  In that 
particular case we had the actual phishing email, so we knew the apparent 
recipient – the CEO of a large Russian bank. The email was apparently sent from 
“Mrs. World”; note the Mrs.,  and not Miss - World.  
 
 

 
The weaponized Microsoft Word document attached to the email message 
(“photo.doc”) contained two separate exploits: one targeting the vulnerability 
detailed in CVE-2012-0158 (MSCOMCTL ActiveX Buffer Overflow); the other 
targeting the aforementioned CVE-2014-1761.

We soon discovered that our malware repository contained several other, similar 
documents, but these had come from other sources which did not include the 
email message, or any identifiable information about the targets. However, the 
text of the documents covered a variety of topics mostly revolving around 
Russian issues relating to a variety of business sectors. The following pages 
highlight a representative selection of these documents.

Document metadata 
 
 
All documents that we have found so far have been rather standard Word 
documents, of the old 97-2003 compatible format based on OLE2. 
 
Such documents can, and typically do, contain quite a bit of metadata: The name 
of the document creator; the user who edited it most recently; the name of the 
company whose copy of Word was used to create the document, et al. Users can 
optionally configure Word to remove this metadata when a document is saved, 
and that’s exactly what the creator of these documents did, stripping out this 
potential source of attribution data. 
 
However, Word documents in this format contain additional information, if you 
know where to look. 
 
All Word documents of this format contain what’s known as a File Information 
Block (FIB). The FIB contains information about the file’s internal structure, and 
also – to some extent – data on the program used to create the file. In the case 
of the samples we analyzed, all of the documents were saved using the same 
build of Microsoft Word from Office14 (better known as Office 2010). 
 
In addition, documents can contain slack space in which old data remains. For 
example, the decoy that came with the attack named “Organigrama Gobierno 
Rusia.doc” contains Visual Basic leftovers indicating that it originally was created 
on a computer that was configured to be used by a native Spanish speaker, 
apparently by an advisor at the Spanish Embassy in Moscow. This document 
was presumably obtained by the attackers and repurposed for the attack.

Targeted verticals 
 
 
Despite the limited information at our disposal about the targets of these attacks, 
their content reveals some context about who the possible targets may have 
been. 
  
First of all, we have the decoy documents which indicate an interest in: 
 

-  Embassies 
-  Politics 
-  Finance 
-  Military 
-  Engineering 

 

 
 
 
 
 

  

 
We also have a set of phishing mails, which were targeted at: 

-  The finance sector in Russia 
-  The oil and energy industry in Romania, Venezuela, and Mozambique 
-  Embassies and diplomats from various countries

Shellcode 
 
 
The shellcode used is a pretty standard variant previously used by a number of 
campaigns typically operating out of China, but with some minor changes. The 
malicious content is stored inside the document in encoded form, and the 
shellcode decodes and writes this to disk. 
 
 

 

 
Above: The decoding loop 
 
 
Upon successful execution this code drops a Word document and a Visual Basic 
script.  The Word document is displayed to the user to avoid arousing any 
suspicion while the script is executed in the background.  
 
Unusual for many exploit campaigns, the names of the dropped files vary; for 
example HyHa9AJ.vbs, ew_Rg.vbs, 0_QHdN.vbs, etc. – clearly randomized in 
order to avoid detection by name. 
 
 

 

  

11 

Visual Basic Script dropper 
 
 
The VBScript dropper code is also a little unusual. It declares a Windows 
Management Instrumentation (WMI) object in order to reach components like the 
registry and file system. This seems adapted from Microsoft example code, like 
the one found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa387236(v=vs.85).aspx 
 
 
 

 
 
 
When the VBSript is run it drops two files to disk. One is a polymorphed dll file 
and the other a binary data file with no obvious internal structure. This data file 
turns out to be encrypted using AES-256. 
 
 

 

 

  

12 

 
 

ex. “C:\Users\USERNAME” 

ex.  “C:\Windows”. 
ex.  “C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming” 

The files will be installed in several locations: 
 
%WinDir%,    
%APPDATA%,  
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%,  ex. “C:\ProgramData” 
%CommonProgramFiles%, ex. “C:\Program Files\Common Files” 
%USERPROFILE%,  
 
These locations will vary some between operating system versions. 
 
The VBScript then sets a startup key in the 
“HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” registry path to 
execute the DLLs at boot time. 
 
Regardless of whether the registry launches the DLL or when another malware 
executable starts the DLL directly, the DLL is launched using regsrv32.exe with 
the /s (silent) option. 
 
The names of these dropped files change from attack to attack. The one above 
drops ctfmonrc.dll. Other names observed were: 
 
ctfmonm.dll 
ctfmonrn.dll 
wmiprvse.dll 
alg.dll 
dwm.dll 
 
The encrypted data files are named using random words apparently taken from a 
dictionary – “acholias”, “arzner”, “bicorporate”, “crockrell”, “damnatorily” etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

  

13 

DLL payload 
 
Looking at one of the dropped dlls we can see the authors originally called it 
95Num3P3gm.dll.polymorphed.dll.  When executed it will rebuild the original dll 
(95Num3p3gm.dll, presumably), load it from memory and pass over execution.   
 

  

 
In the early stages of our research, most other payloads followed the same 
naming convention, eg., fvK3J15B5d.DLL.polymorphed.DLL; 
LvwU9gnFO.DLL.polymorphed.DLL; NR5vaFTe9R.DLL.polymorphed.DLL; 
hs78lg7x5F.DLL.polymorphed.DLL, etc. More recently collected samples no 
longer contain the “polymorphed” string. 
 
It is hard to describe the polymorphed dlls with any real depth, as there is little 
consistency between them.  When two nearly identical dlls are encoded using the 
polymorphic scheme there is very little code in common.  The call graphs are 
different and key functions have varying number of arguments. The polymorphing 
mechanism also generates, and inserts, unique functions all of which make calls 
to different floating-point operations – all done just to obfuscate the actual 
decoding process.  The sizes of buffers allocated are also randomized to mask 
their intent.  

  

14 

 

 
A portion of one of the dynamically generated functions. 
 
What is common is that somewhere along the execution cycle is one extremely 
large function (over 200 kb in length) where early in a large allocation is made 
where the un-obfuscated binary will be placed.  The binary is then built from de-
obfuscating segments of it that have been dispersed through the ‘.rdata’ section.  
The order, size, and locations of these segments vary from build to build but 
somewhere near the end of the large function there will be a call to a subfunction 
that loads the PE image into memory, followed by a call to free the PE image 
allocation from memory. Simply halting execution before this function call permits 
a researcher to extract the reconstructed DLL from memory. 

  

15 

 

 
 
Here, pausing execution before the call to ‘load_pe_from_memory’ reveals the 
extracted PE at the memory address pointed to by edx. 
 
This reconstructed DLL, once loaded, will decode a configuration structure from 
its ‘.data’ section which contains three important details: the name of the 
encrypted data file dropped by the VBScript; the AES key used to decrypt the file; 
and the name of a unique global mutex to hold while running to prevent multiple 
instances. 
 
This configuration information is used to load the encrypted file into memory and 
decrypt it. This turns out to be yet another dll. The first ordinal exported by this dll 
is located and then called, passing in the configuration and the name of the 
encrypted file on disk as parameters. 

  

16 

 

 
 
This last dll is the heart of the threat (originally called q5Byo.dll in this instance. 
This file contains the true intent of this campaign.  It is designed as a survey tool. 
The PE file gathers system information including OS version, computer name, 
user name, user group membership, the process it is running in, locale ID’s,  as 
well as system drive and volume information. All of this is encrypted and then 
sent to cloud storage via WebDAV.

The malware installation chain 

 

 

  

18 

WebDAV cloud usage 
 
WebDAV is a communication standard that allows file management over HTTP 
or HTTPS. Windows allows WebDAV sessions to be mapped as network 
resources. 
 
The use of WebDAV as the communication channel is atypical for most malware 
samples we see. By using a network resource, the actual web traffic originates 
from the system itself, and not from the process in which the malware resides. 
Additionally, once the resource is established, the malware can transfer files to 
and from the command and control servers using standard file IO commands.  
 
All the authentication information for the WebDAV session including the URL, 
folders, path, user name, and password is stored within this last DLL in another 
AES-encrypted configuration structure in the binary. 
 
A unique path, username, and password were used for each malware instance 
we’ve seen in the wild.  This allows the attackers to uniquely identify every 
targeted attack and track how successful each phishing campaign is. 
 
Also contained within the configuration structure is information on how to name 
the survey data on the remote file server.  The binary reads from its configuration 
a string on how to generate the remote filename, and a list of extensions to use.  
An example would be “_1-7d_0-8s”, [“TIF”, “TAR”, “SIT”] which instructs the 
binary to generate a filename with 1 to 7 numeric digit characters followed by 0 to 
8 ASCII letters with one of the three listed extensions such as “664gher.TAR”.  
The survey is then uploaded to the server in a specified folder with the generated 
name.   
 
Files are compressed using a modified LZMA-compression and encrypted using 
AES cipher-block-chaining (CBC) before being uploaded to the cloud server. 
 
The binary also checks a separate folder on the cloud service designated to 
contain new configuration information. If such a file is present on the server, the 
malware downloads the new configuration file then deletes it from the server.  
 
 

 

  

19 

The cloud storage provider in every case we have seen was the Swedish 
company CloudMe.com, which offers free and paid WebDAV cloud storage.  
 
 

 

 
 
The URI model used by the malware is 
http://webdav.cloudme.com/%username%/CloudDrive/ which is a direct 
reference to file storage. 
 
It must be noted that the CloudMe service is not actively spreading the malicious 
content; the attackers are only using it for storing their files. 
 
We notified CloudMe.com about the abuse of their services. Their CEO, Mr. 
Daniel Arthursson, was none too happy about this, and was very helpful in our 
further research. CloudMe has shared a great deal of log information related to 
this attack. These indicate that there are many other accounts (over 100) likely 
related to this attack system. We have no way of verifying this with absolute 
certainty, but this is what we regard as a high confidence assumption. 
 
 

 

  

20 

 

Distribution of logged victim connections towards CloudMe. 
 
 
The cloud accounts are not used for one-way communication only. The malware 
also checks configured subfolders for updates; and if these are found they will be 
downloaded, decrypted and used as appropriate. 
 
One such case is the franko7046 account, used against the previously 
mentioned bank CEO. In this account there was hidden another encrypted 
configuration file which the malware downloaded and decrypted. 
 

 
Above: The configuration file of the depp3353 account. Password is redacted. 
 

 

  

21 

This is how we found the depp3353 account. In this new account there was 
another surprise waiting for us – a download folder with two new encrypted files, 
921.bin and 922.bin. Once decrypted, these turned out to be PE executables. 
 
 
Downloaded plugins: Cloud persistence 
 
The two new executables are plugins - quite similar to each other and obviously 
compiled on the same setup. They are lightweight and intended to pull specific 
survey information from their target. Of interest, both of the DLLs originally had 
the same internal name (78wO13YrJ0cB.dll).  Presumably the same PE 
sanitization script and parameters were used on both.  
 
None of these plugins contain any means of CnC communication. Instead, when 
they are executed they are passed a pointer to a function to use for sending data 
back home. Neither are they ever written to disk. They are executed in memory 
only, and once they have completed the memory is freed. This makes these 
modules extremely stealthy, flexible and compatible with multiple toolsets 
independent of what CnC method is being used. 
 
921.bin retrieves several datapoints about the infected machine: Domain info; a 
list of running processes with all loaded modules in each; the list of installed 
software; and a complete hardware profile of the target machine. 922.bin 
compiles a dirwalk – a complete listing of every file path – of each fixed drive. All 
of this information is exfiltrated back via the same WebDAV connection. 
 
This model makes it possible to do the intrusion in steps, with verification stages 
in between; and the files will not be easily found on affected computers. 
 
Based on the information gathered from these modules, the attackers appear to 
move to the next stage of their attack by placing more new components on the 
WebDAV shares. Information about these uploads is limited by the fact that we 
do not have the AES keys to decrypt much of the uploaded data, but we have 
been able to see some upload patterns.  
 
What we assume to be third-stage plugins appear on the shares as *.bin files of 
roughly 72kb. As with other plugins, these are downloaded and deleted from the 
share in one go. However, the next day, another *.bin file of the same size will be 
uploaded to the share. This is a pattern that repeats itself over all live accounts. It 
seems that because the plugins exist in memory only, they are injected daily to 
ensure persistence on victim computers. Our theory is that this malware is a 
more typical datastealer, and we have observed that after this type of file is 
planted on the account, encrypted data uploads from compromised users 
increase. 
 

 

  

22 

The Sheep and the Wolves 
 
Victims of this attack will connect using the Windows WebDAV redirector, and 
the HTTP request user-agent string will reflect this. For Windows XP this will 
typically be “Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/5.1.2600”, and for Windows 7 a 
common user-agent is “Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.1.7601”. 
 
Security researchers – and there are a few of them - connect in a variety of ways; 
first of all, we see a number of connections that are indistinguishable from the 
way victims connect. This happens when researchers use lab machines with live 
internet access to run the malware. The only way we can tell these are 
researchers is because they connect from IP address ranges that are unlikely to 
be victims; and they also tend to consist of short-lived sessions. 
 
Some researchers set up scheduled tasks to scan the shares for new updates 
and malware. We see a few variations of these – one typical configuration is 
where the requests contain a Python-related user-agent string. 
 
Attackers, on the other hand, don’t appear to use Windows. 
Common across multiple accounts, multiple IP’s, and over time, is that the 
probable attackers have used a HTTP user-agent of “davfs2/1.4.6 neon/0.29.6”.  
 
We know these are not researchers, because we can see malware files being 
uploaded by them: 
 
[17/Sep/2014:09:42:38 +0200] "PUT 
/white3946/CloudDrive/QxM9C/st/V1oINDJtnqy/1768.bin 
HTTP/1.0" 201 0 "-" "davfs2/1.4.6 neon/0.29.6" 
 
Above: Log entry for the account white3946. We have been unable to locate the 
malware that uses this account. 
 
We have a log fragment in which the attackers uploaded a sequential series of 
updates (from 1746.bin to 1774.bin) within 1.5 hours on Sept 17th, spread over 
27 different accounts and using 27 different IP addresses in the process. 
 
The user-agent string shows that attackers likely have used a client based on the 
open source davfs2 file system for Linux to mount the WebDAV shares. 
 
 

 

  

23 

This client is used when uploading new malware, but also when the attackers 
scan their shares for new victim updates, in which case the shares are 
enumerated by requests in a scheduled manner. 
 

 

 

 
An attacker scans the tem5842 account for updates. 
 

 
At intervals, scans hop to new IP addresses. 
 
The attackers have used a large number of IP addresses to access the shares. 
As mentioned above, there is a rotation scheme in place in which a new IP 
address will be used after a few minutes of access against CloudMe accounts. 
 
These IP’s are distributed widely over geographical locations and service 
providers, with a heavy bias towards South Korean ranges.

PART II:  
Support infrastructure 

 

 

  

26 

An embedded device proxy network  
 
A superficial examination of the proxy IP addresses that connected to CloudMe 
showed them to be internet-connected devices of various kinds. Many were 
Korean Tera-EP home routers; but there were several other products 
represented. 
 
 

 
 
It is believed that the attackers were able to compromise these devices based on 
poor configurations or default credentials.   
 
We were able to do some forensic work on a compromised Tera-EP TE-800 
device and discovered another dimension of the attacker’s infrastructure.   
 

 

 

  

27 

 

Router malware 
 
Under the ramfs mounted partition we found a stripped and statically linked 
MIPS-el binary named tail-.  Instances of this were also found under the running 
process list.  
 
tail- serves as a SOCKS proxy for the attackers.  Each sample of the binary we 
were able to acquire was configured with a unique 32byte blowfish key and a 
small, encrypted section appended to the end of the binary.   
 
Upon execution the binary uses its hardcoded key to decrypt the configuration 
section and retrieve the listening port to use for incoming connections.  This acts 
as a management interface. From here the attackers can request a specific port 
to be opened as one of the following types: SOCKET, SOCKSS, SOCKAT, 
SOCKS5, or STATUSPORT.   
 
To prevent anyone else from accessing this service all communication on the 
management interface is encrypted using the same blowfish key.  This means 
that the attackers must maintain a list of where each of these implants are 
installed, as well as what port and key each is configured to use.  
 
This setup makes it difficult to identify embedded devices compromised with this 
malware by scanning open ports. 
 
In the wild we witnessed the attackers connect to the management port and 
request SOCKSS connections.  This would open the specified port and wait for 
configuration data, which consists of a domain name (webdav.cloudme.com), the 
destination port, and a variable length RC4 key, all of which encrypted using the 
blowfish key.   Once received the malware would attempt to connect to the 
domain name on the specified port and would start tunneling all traffic received 
from the SOCKSS port to the destination and vise-versa. The communication 
between the attacker and the SOCKSS is encoded using the RC4 key.  The 
graphic below illustrates a typical session. 
 

 

  

 

28 

Additional servers 
 
The router proxy network provides another layer of indirection masking the 
attackers’ infrastructure. However, because we captured traffic through one of 
these embedded devices we could identify other parts of their operation. 
 
We identified four IP addresses that connected to the proxy malware: 
 
Cloud enumerator:  
Apparently a rented server at AS34224 NETERRA-AS, Bulgaria 
 
This host belongs to a Bulgarian VPS service and would use the router proxy to 
connect to webdav.cloudme.com. This host does all scanning of webdav shares 
for stolen user data, and also uploads new malware components. 
 
Health checker: 
Apparently a rented server at AS5577 ROOT root SA, Luxembourg. 
 
This IP would make connections hourly and poll the status of the router proxy 
malware. This machine is most likely used to track which compromised routers 
are currently available for use.   
 
Unlocker: 
Apparently a rented server at AS52048 DATACLUB DataClub S.A. Latvia.  
 
Traffic from this IP had a very specific purpose: It unlocked routers for proxying in 
connection with the sending of phishing emails. 
 
In the wild we observed this IP connect to our router on the malware 
management port and specify a SOCKSS proxy port to be opened. Immediately 
after, the newly opened port would be connected to by another IP and used to 
send phishing emails with malicious attachments. 
 
However, later we observed that the Email sender IP at VOLIA vanished and the 
Unlocker server taking over its role as well. 
 
Email sender: 
An IP at AS25229 VOLIA-AS, Ukraine. Possibly a compromised host. 
 
After a router SOCKSS port was opened by Unlocker, this IP would connect to 
the opened port and tunnel its email traffic through the router. 
 
Each of these connections used the correct encryption key, so we know that 
these accesses came from the attackers and not some opportunistic third party. 
 
 

 

  

29 

Mail proxies: 
 
Through our router monitoring we identified two mail proxies used by the 
attackers. We were later notified by Symantec (thanks, guys!) about a third. 
These servers were hosted on domains that were registered by the attackers, 
using domain names clearly meant to look legitimate. This is the only time we 
have seen attackers register domains in this investigation. 
 
The mail proxies were: 
 
haarmannsi.cz 
sanygroup.co.uk 
ecolines.es 
 
Registrant WHOIS information seems forged: 
 
haarmannsi.cz

Observed phishing emails 
 
The connections made from the Ukrainian host to the router were interesting. 
After being proxied though the router, each of these would authenticate with one 
of the dedicated mail proxies and send out phishing attacks.  
 
From captured traffic it appears that the mail proxies have SOCKSv5 services 
running on obscure high ports. We have documented that the attackers log in to 
these using apparently randomly generated usernames and passwords, a unique 
pair for each server. The mail proxy would then relay the spearphishing mail as 
seen below. 
 

 
Above: Captured SMTP session, sending the malicious attachment MQ1474.doc 
 
This way the attack can be mistaken to come from legitimate businesses and 
trusted organizations.  In some cases the organization from which the phishing 
email originates would appear to be a known associate to the target. 
 

 

 

  

31 

The email shown above was one of a number of messages sent to targets in the 
oil industry. Investigating the target email addresses, we saw several of these 
were found in this public document from the World Petroleum Council, including 
some addresses that are, at the present time, no longer valid.  
 
And then, the ground shifted again.

PART III:  
Attacks on mobile devices 

 
 

 

  

33 

One of the spearphishing mails we observed coming through the router network 
was this one, sent to an address under the gov.py (Government of Paraguay) 
domain. 
 

 

 
Get WhatsApp now for your iPhone, Android, BlackBerry or Windows Phone  
 
There was no executable attachment in this mail, but instead a link shortened by 
the URL shortener service bit.ly, with the underlying link pointing to an IP address 
on a Dutch hosting service. Clicking that link from a Windows PC only yielded a 
redirection to the BBC homepages, and using other devices did not give more 
data.  
 
The bit.ly service does however provide information on the user creating the 
shortened link, and other links associated with this account. In this case, the user 
was named nicolatesla53. 
 
 

  

34 

 

The nicolatesla53 bit.ly profile page 
 
The nicolatesla53 account was created in July 2014. From Oct 24th to Nov 21st 
this user created nearly 10000 shortened links – we harvested 9990 unique 
ones. Three IP addresses were used for these links: 
 
82.221.100.55 
82.221.100.60 
94.102.50.60 
 
The links themselves were on this format: 
 
http://server_ip/page/index?id=target_identifier&type2=action_code 
 
As far as we were able to tell, there were three main types of action_code: 
 
743 
1024  : Serve malware disguised as Viber updates 
other  : Serve MMS phishing content. The code identifies mobile operator and 
determines which logo will be displayed when the user follows the link. 
 
 

: Serve malware disguised as WhatsApp updates 

  

35 

MMS Phishing 
 
We have no sample of the actual MMS phishing messages apparently being 
sent, but we can see the page served when a user clicks a spammed link. This is 
just a dialogue box asking for the password presumably included in the initial 
message, and the next stage likely involves download of malicious content. 
 
 

 

The password screen for action code 16611 (TELE2) 
 
We were in the middle of harvesting the servers for data on the various action 
codes when they all were abruptly taken offline; so our data on which mobile 
operators are targeted is not complete. We managed to get 66 of a total of 190. 
The ones we know of are shown below.  A full breakdown of mobile operators 
and related links is included in the appendix. 
 

  

 

36 

The composition of links created for the various mobile operators is quite 
interesting, as one can speculate that they represent amount of actual or planned 
attacks in different countries. With the top three operators being Vodafone, T-
Mobile and Proximus (Belgacom) it seems these apparent phishing attacks are 
less focused on the Russian sphere than the previously discussed malware.  
 
This map is not complete, though. It represents only about 35% (66/190) of all 
mobile operators targeted and 66% (3152/4781) of all phishing links we managed 
to harvest. In addition, some operators like Vodafone are global actors, so the 
map might show an unfair intensity in their HQ locations. 
 
 

 
MMS phishing heat map 
 
 
The rest of the bit.ly links used the action codes 743 or 1024. And now things 
really get interesting. By using mobile device HTTP User-Agents we were able to 
trigger downloads of malware components from some of these links. 
 

 

 

  

37 

Mobile malware: Android 
 
 
Accessing the link from an Android User-Agent initiated a download of an 
Android installer package named WhatsAppUpdate.apk. The package we 
analyzed was 1.2MB in size. 
 
The apparent main purpose of this malware is to record phone call audio. 
Recordings are stored as *.mp4 files, and uploaded to the attackers periodically. 
 
The malware is able to collect a lot of other information, not all of which is 
actually used: 
 

•  Account data 
•  Location 
•  Contacts 
•  External and Internal Storage (files written) 
•  Audio (microphone) 
•  Outgoing calls  
• 
Incoming calls 
•  Call log 
•  Calendar 
•  Browser bookmarks 
• 
 

Incoming SMS 

Through the encrypted C&C protocol, the attackers can issue commands and 
binary updates to the malware. 
 
It uses a custom DAO/Database scheme which uses accounts belonging to the 
virtual community Live Journal (livejournal.com) as data stores. Three such 
accounts were found hardcoded in the package: 
 

 
The accounts all state that they belong to Iranian users. This is very likely false. 
 

 

  

38 

 
 
The text in these posts starts first out in cleartext, but quickly turns into 
unreadable gibberish. The HTML source code reveals that the encoded portion is 
encapsulated in blog-index tags: 

 

 
The three accounts contain different configuration blocks pointing to C&C servers 
apparently located in Poland, Germany and Russia, respectively. Based on 
registration data and folder configuration we believe these are legitimate but 
compromised Joomla servers. 
 
And then an unexpected oddity shows up in the Java source: 
 

 

 
The sign in front of SizeRandomStr is “Truti” - a Hindi word meaning “Error”. 
 
 
 

 

 

  

39 

We were also able to download a similar malware sample (BrowserUpdate.apk) 
from one of the C&C servers. This sample used different online accounts for its 
DAO/database functionality, but is otherwise quite similar to the first. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

  

40 

Mobile malware: Apple IOS 
 
 
Using an IOS User-Agent triggered the download of a Debian installer package, 
WhatsAppUpdate.deb, also 1.2Mb in size. 
 
This application impersonates a Cydia installer, and can only be installed on a 
jailbroken phone. 
 
 
Once installed, it may collect

41 

These data are encrypted and uploaded to an FTP account which is taken from 
an encrypted configuration file named /usr/bin/cores. 
 
In this particular case, the FTP account is located on a legitimate (if struggling) 
hosting service in the UK. 
 
In this case, there’s another clue: 
 

 
The project path in the package contains the name JohnClerk. 
 
The WhatsAppUpdate project seems derived from an earlier template named 
SkypeUpdate. 
 
 

 

 

  

42 

Mobile malware: Blackberry 
 
 
By now, it came as no surprise when we triggered a download with a BlackBerry 
User-Agent. The initial download was a Java Applications Descriptor, a text file 
designed for Over-The-Air installation of Java-based applications. This JAD file 
contained the locations of the two Blackberry *.COD binaries which we then 
could download directly. 
 
The application impersonates a settings utility. This collects:

“God_Save_The_Queen” is used as a reference in one of the Blackberry 
binaries. 
 
Since these COD files are also compiled Java code, they are possible to

find interesting strings there. This time they are in Arabic:

Timelines and activity patterns 
 
The earliest sample of Inception-related malware we have been able to obtain, 
was submitted to us in June 2014. However, decoy document metadata shows 
that it was created late May. The related cloud account was created just before 
that. An examination of the other documents associated with the attacks show 
that they have been created at a steady pace all through summer and autumn 
2014 and attacks are still ongoing. 
 
Of interest is also the attackers’ activity patterns over the 24h cycle. The main 
upload of new components to shares seems to be divided over two high–activity 
periods: 6:00 -10:00 UTC and 17:00 - 21:00 UTC. No uploads were seen 
between 23:00 and 05:00 UTC.  
 
It is however doubtful how indicative these timeframes are. To illustrate, we 
looked into another and more obscure timing factor: The timing of the AES 
InitVector random seeds. A random seed is the initial value passed into a 
pseudo-randomizer function. The malware uses the random output to create 
what is known as an InitVector - a starting point for the AES 
encryption/decryption function. 
 
The code used in some of the DLLs indicate that the attackers tend to use the C 
time() function to generate random seeds. This function returns values of 
granularity down to seconds. Thus random seeds, and ultimately the InitVectors, 
are functions of these quite coarse units of time. 
 
The encrypted files uploaded to the WebDAV shares come with their InitVectors 
stored at the end of the file. Since we know the time window to be within a few 
days of the upload time we were able to brute force the time values that would 
generate the corresponding InitVectors. Thus, we were able to say to the second 
when the file was created – and most times were identified to be in the range 
1500 - 2200 GMT. 
 
Unfortunately, we had to reject these data. The file creation times turned out to 
be hours after the files themselves were uploaded to the WebDAV share. Either 
the attackers’ system clock is wrong or a fixed offset is added to the random 
seed. Either way, the data can’t be trusted; and shows that nothing can be taken 
at face value.

The Chinese connection 
 
On at least two occasions during our surveillance of the Inception framework, the 
malware downloaded something unexpected and wholly different from what we 
have discussed until now. 
 
These files were downloaded as encrypted *.bin files from the accounts 
carter0648 and frogs6352. When decrypted, these turned out to be dropper 
packages containing one dropper executable clearly created for the Inception 
framework, and one other, very different executable. 
 
This executable, (sccm.exe, md5 dd8790455109497d49c2fa2442cf16f7) is a 
classical Chinese APT implant. It is a downloader and remote shell program, 
designed to connect to a C&C server to interact with the attacker and/or 
download more malware. 
 
The C&C server in this case is ict32.msname.org.  
 
When connecting to this server, sccm.exe issues the following request: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This C&C domain is used by many other malwares related to sccm.exe; some of 
which share obvious connections to the Quarian malware family, a known APT 
intrusion tool. 
 
This development was unexpected for several reasons. First of all, it apparently 
breaks the strict, obfuscatory operational security built into the Inception 
framework. Inception has the capacity to perform all steps needed for scouting 
out and exfiltrating data without resorting to traditional hosted command & 
control. By using a well-understood APT tool and a known malicious C&C 
domain name, the attackers permit much clearer attribution.

47 

Another factor which is out of character is the coding style. All Inception-related 
malware is written using Visual Studio 2010. The downloaded sccm.exe is written 
using Visual C++ 6; and has a PE header compile date of October 2010. 
This date can be forged, and indeed, all Inception-related malware has some 
level of forgery in the compile dates. However, the sccm.exe compile date 
matches the Quarian developer toolset and coding style to a better degree than 
the other files distributed through Inception. 
 
Then there is the C&C domain used. According to DomainTools.com the 
msname.org domain registration timed out September 27th 2014. It was left 
inactive and was not renewed until Nov 12th. This means that the attackers 
distributed malware that would be out of action for a long time (last distribution of 
sccm.exe was September 26th). 
 
Because of all this we consider sccm.exe as an unreliable indicator. It is likely to 
be a red herring purposefully placed on shares where the attackers have seen 
signs of access by security researchers.  
 
 
An odd indicator 
 
At one instance the attackers seem to have slipped up. Instead of using their 
scheduled task, they apparently did something manually on a WebDAV share. 
This is visible because the request came from an apparent attacker IP, but used 
yet another User-Agent: “gvfs/1.12.3”.   
 
Gvfs is the virtual filesystem for Gnome desktop. The action on the account was 
abnormal as well; an apparent file upload: 
 
83.53.147.144 - - [02/Sep/2014:09:53:56 +0200] "PUT 
/tem5842/Documento%20sin%20t%C3%ADtulo HTTP/1.1" 408 0 "-" 
"gvfs/1.12.3" 
 
 “Documento sin título” means “Untitled document” in Spanish. 
 
When WebDAV shares are mapped up as drives by the operating system, any 
action taken by the attacker follows the same pattern as on the attacker’s local 
drive. In the case above, it seems the attacker attempted to edit a new 
document, which by default is given the name “Untitled document” in Gnome.  
 
This might indicate that the attacker’s operating system language is Spanish. 
Of course, Spanish is one of the world’s most widespread languages, so one 
cannot infer much from this. There is even a small possibility that the 
phenomenon is a pure artifact; for example that a Spanish-speaking researcher 
connected to the same account using the same Linux-based setup as the 
attackers.

-  Similar overall loading architecture, with dropping of encrypted binaries

Similarities with Red October 
 
 
This attack system shares a number of properties that are somewhat similar with 
the Red October campaigns detailed by Kaspersky Labs in 2013. 
For more information about this see: 
 
The "Red October" Campaign - An Advanced Cyber Espionage Network 
Targeting Diplomatic and Government Agencies 
 

-  Target countries and verticals overlap to some extent 
-  The topics of some decoy documents are the same (eg. “Diplomatic 

-  Exploited documents contain certain similarities (i.e. the magic string 

“PT@T” used as a marker to locate the shellcode) 

 
 
However, there are also clear differences. The code is fully rewritten; there 
appears to be little code overlap, at least in the initial stage malware. The coding 
style is different, with different solutions to programmatic problems, different use 
of exception handling, and different use of C++ classes. It’s hard to believe that 
the same programmers are responsible for the two code bases. 
 
The Red October malware contained linguistic markers that pointed towards 
Russian speaking attackers. No such clues have been found in the Inception-
related malware; there is a marked difference in the attention to detail and 
information leakage. 
 
It is certainly possible that the same people have organized both Inception and 
Red October, but there are no clear indications to this effect.

Strings in malware 
 
 
The Windows-based malware in this paper generally contains very few 
noticeable strings apart from what is commonly found in software, and clearly 
randomized strings. What exists – like the word “polymorphed” in the early DLL 
versions - is standard English with few discerning features. 
 
This changes a bit when we look at the mobile malware. In the Android malware 
we find Hindi comments in the Java source code. In the Iphone malware we find 
project paths referencing one “JohnClerk”, and a few typos like “conutry”. In one 
of the Blackberry binaries we find the string “God_Save_The_Queen”, a rather 
blunt hint towards Britain, as well as Arabic log strings. 
 
These and other indicators have led us to conclude that the Inception attackers 
are setting a new standard for deliberate disinformation and red herrings in a 
malware espionage operation. Some clues might have been added by accident, 
but none of these indicators can be trusted in any way. Thus we are not going to 
assume anything about who might be behind these attacks. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  

50 

Conclusion 
 
 
The whole Inception setup shows signs of automation and seasoned 
programming.  The amount of layers used in this scheme to protect the payload 
of their attack seems excessively paranoid. Not only is the initial DLL apparently 
polymorphed using some backend tool – the compile time stamps in the PE 
header are clearly forged,  resources are removed so as not to give away any 
location information, and import tables are shuffled around, rendering import 
hashes (aka imphashes) useless. 
 
The names of the files both when dropped and their original names along with 
the callback directories, paths and mutexes used all seem to be dynamically 
generated.  
 
The attackers utilize compromised embedded devices – typically routers- on the 
Internet as well as multiple dedicated hosting providers and VPN services to 
mask their identity from the cloud storage provider and others. The same router 
botnet is used as a spreading and management platform for attacks on mobile 
devices as well. 
 
This suggests that this a large campaign and we’ve only seeing the beginning of 
it.  Initially many of the targets were located in Russia or related to Russian 
interests, but as the campaign has evolved we have verified targets in countries 
all over the world.  
 
It is clear that this infrastructure model does not need to be applied solely against 
a few targets, or even need to be hosted at CloudMe. The framework is generic, 
and will work as an attack platform for a multitude of purposes with very little 
modification. 
 
The attribution indicators point in different directions and can’t be given much 
weight. These attacks can in theory be the creation of nation states or 
resourceful private entities - we consider it very unlikely that they are performed 
by one or just a few individuals.
