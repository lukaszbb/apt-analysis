Episode 16 

Thank you for subscribing to Episode 16 of the HP Security Briefing. In this 
edition we discuss the cyber landscape within the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea. 

Introduction 

The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known in the West as North Korea, is a unique 
country with a military-focused society and an unconventional technology infrastructure. While 
North Korea was formerly on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, it was removed in 2008.1 
However, due to North Korea’s hostility toward other nations, its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and 
human rights violations against its own citizens, the United Nations and many Western entities 
have placed sanctions and embargoes against North Korea.2 3 For example, U.S. export laws 
forbid the sale of dual-use technologies, or those that can be used or repurposed for both civilian 
and military use, to North Korea.4 5 Additionally, the U.S. has a military alliance with the Republic of 
Korea (ROK), known in the West as South Korea, North Korea’s primary target of conflict.6  
 
Due to North Korea’s global interactions, its cyber warfare capabilities are of particular interest to 
the U.S. According to a 2009 report by Major Steve Sin, an intelligence analyst at U.S. Forces 
Korea, North Korean hackers have successfully penetrated U.S. defense networks more 
frequently than any other country that has targeted U.S. defense assets.7 While Major Sin may 
have been overly optimistic about North Korea’s abilities, it is clear that they should not be 
underestimated. Frank Cilluffo, co-director of the Cyber Center for National and Economic Security 
at George Washington University, testified before Congress that North Korea’s cyber capability 
"poses an important 'wild card' threat, not only to the United States but also to the region and 
broader international stability…"8 In an April 2014 testimony given to the House Armed Services 
Committee, General Curtis M. Scaparrotti noted that “North Korea remains a significant threat to 
United States’ interests, the security of South Korea, and the international community due to its 
willingness to use force, its continued development and proliferation of nuclear weapon and long-
range ballistic missile programs, and its abuse of its citizens’ human rights, as well as the 
legitimate interests of its neighbors and the international community.” Scaparrotti stressed that 
“While North Korea’s massive conventional forces have been declining due to aging and lack of 
resources…North Korea is emphasizing the development of its asymmetric capabilities. North

Korea’s asymmetric arsenal includes…an active cyber warfare capability.”9 While one would expect 
the regime’s digital infrastructure to also suffer from aging or lack of resources, these factors do 
not take away from their technical abilities to wage cyber warfare. 
 
While the U.S. views North Korea’s cyber warfare program as the regime’s foray into modern 
asymmetrical warfare, South Korea views the regime’s cyber capabilities as a terroristic threat, -a 
build-up for an impending multifaceted attack. It is important to note that, to date, no such attack 
has occurred. According to a report written by Captain Duk-Ki Kim, Republic of Korea Navy officer 
and Ph.D. “…the North Korean regime will first conduct a simultaneous and multifarious cyber 
offensive on the Republic of Korea’s society and basic infrastructure, government agencies, and 
major military command centers while at the same time suppressing the ROK government and its 
domestic allies and supporters with nuclear weapons.”10  South Korea’s view of North Korea as a 
terroristic threat may be an attempt to downgrade North Korea politically, since South Korea does 
not recognize the regime as a legitimate state.11 South Korean reports also claim that North 
Korea’s premier hacking unit, Unit 121, trails Russia and the U.S. as the world’s third largest cyber 
unit. 12  While this claim may be exaggerated, in 2012, South Korean reports estimated North 
Korea’s hacker forces at around 3000 personnel. In a July 2014 report from South Korea’s Yonhap 
News Agency, that figure was upgraded to 5900 hacker elite.13 We must stress that although 
these claims have not been corroborated, South Korea has taken the regime’s cyber threats very 
seriously and is reportedly training 5000 personnel to defend against North Korean cyber 
attacks.14 
 
Obtaining details on North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities is not an easy task. This paper will 
examine the known cyber capabilities of North Korea’s regime and how the country maintains 
secrecy in these matters. Through information obtained via open source intelligence (OSINT), we 
will present what is known about North Korea’s cyber warfare and supporting intelligence and 
psychological operations capabilities.  
 
Research roadblocks  

The following conditions proved to be research roadblocks when gathering intelligence regarding 
North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities:  

  Much of the intelligence available on North Korea is dated and may not accurately reflect 

the regime’s current capabilities.  

  Much of the intelligence available on North Korea comes from U.S. or South Korean 

military or agency reports. These reports omit details that are likely classified, such as 
specific IP addresses and individual actor information.  

  While South Korea is an ally of the United States, its reports on North Korean cyber 

activity potentially contain incomplete or biased information. Cultural factors that stem

from a history of tension and conflict between the two nations may skew perception and 
make objectivity difficult. 15 16 

  North Korea’s Internet infrastructure and the regime’s strict control over its use ensures 

that there are no rogue actors and that all officially sanctioned actors exercise careful 
OPSEC and PERSEC practices in order to prevent inadvertent information leaks. In other 
words, there was no significant identifying information in the form of an OSINT trail left 
behind by the actors. This hinders collection of original, actionable threat intelligence and 
individual actor attribution.  

  North Korea is well-isolated from the outside world, and its strong intelligence and 

psychological operations presence effectively creates confusion via counterintelligence 
and disinformation about the regime’s capabilities.17 For this reason, any “official” reports 
emanating from North Korea must be taken with a grain of salt. This also hinders 
attempts to obtain original, actionable threat intelligence.  

 
 
Ideological and political context 

In order for Westerners to understand the North Korean mindset, it is necessary to examine the 
key components of North Korean political and ideological thought. It is also necessary to provide a 
brief explanation of how North Korea and South Korea view one another, in order to understand 
the basis for conflict between the two. 

Juche and Songun 

North Korea has two primary ideologies that provide context for the regime’s motivations and 
activities: juche (ju-cheh) and songun (sun-goon). Juche is the official political ideology of North 
Korea. It was instituted in 1972 and is based on the ideologies of Kim Il-Sung, the founder of the 
DPRK. Juche emphasizes self-reliance, mastering revolution and reconstruction in one’s own 
country, being independent of others, displaying one’s strengths, defending oneself, and taking 
responsibility for solving one’s own problems. North Korea’s air-gapped intranet, described below, 
exemplifies this philosophy in the country’s cyber infrastructure. The juche philosophy explains 
North Korea’s disdain for outside cultural and political influence. Juche challenges North Koreans 
to contribute to the regime’s chaju (ja-ju), a concept of national sovereignty and independence.18 
The regime’s greatest fear is internal dissent and resulting destabilization.19 20  In a June 2014 
Reddit AMA session, Dr. Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korean culture and society, noted 
“there are also serious signs of public alienation and discontent. And I cannot rule out a public 
outbreak of such discontent in the near future. Of course, if it happens, it will have a serious 
impact on the government.”21  Despite North Korea’s strong conviction in juche, the regime 
collaborates with and receives support from other nations. However, due to this deep-seated

ideology, it is doubtful that North Korea fully trusts these apparent allies.22 Later in this document, 
we will show that North Korea relies heavily on China for Internet access. North Korea also 
collaborates with China and Russia to train its cyber warriors and has longstanding political and 
military relationships with several nations. 
 
Songun is North Korea’s “military first” doctrine. Songun emphasizes the priority of the military in 
resource allocation and political and economic affairs. 23 This doctrine stems from the belief that 
the military is vital for preservation of chaju.24  Understanding songun mindset gives context for 
this potential threat actor’s motivations. According to a 2013 Congressional report, the strategy 
established under former leader Kim Jong-Il focused on “internal security, coercive diplomacy to 
compel acceptance of its diplomatic, economic and security interests, development of strategic 
military capabilities to deter external attack, and challenging South Korea and the 
U.S.-South Korean alliance."25 
 
North Korea’s songun permeates the lives of all North Korean citizens. Article 58 of 
the North Korean Constitution states that the nation should base itself on a 
nationwide defense system that includes all people.26 North Korea, with a 
population of 25 million, has an active duty force of 1.19 million personnel, the 
fourth largest in the world. The country’s reserve and paramilitary units comprise 
7.7 million additional personnel.27 In other words, over a third of the country’s 
population serves in a military or paramilitary capacity. 
 
Some North Korean youth aged 7-13 are inducted into the Korean Children’s Union. The Korean 
Children’s Union is responsible for indoctrinating youths who pledge to build up their strength to 
later defend the regime.28  
 

Songun is North Korea’s 
“military first” doctrine. 
Songun emphasizes the 
priority of the military in 
resource allocation and 
political and economic 
affairs.  Understanding this 
mindset gives context for a 
potential threat actor’s 
motivations.

Children aged 14-16 can begin military training as members of the Young Red Guards, a 
paramilitary unit. Beginning at age 17, North Koreans are eligible to join the Reserve Military 
Training Unit.31 The Reserve Military Training Unit forms the core of North Korea’s reserves and is 
typically assigned to the front or regional defense in wartime.32 The youngest age at which a 
citizen can be conscripted for active duty is unclear; reported ages range from 18-20. Youths can 
volunteer for active duty service at age 16 or 17.33 The Worker-Peasant Militia, or Red Guards, 
includes males ages 17-60 and unmarried females ages 17-30 who are not part of active duty 
units or the Reserve Military Training Unit.34 
 
The regime has an impressive number of conventional weapons, considering the nation’s small 
land area and population size.35 According to statistics released by CNN in 2014, North Korea’s 
ground arsenal includes 4100 tanks, 2100 armored vehicles, and 8500 pieces of field artillery. 
The regime’s sea weaponry includes 70 submarines, 420 patrol combatants, and 260 amphibious 
landing craft. Their airpower includes 730 combat aircraft, 300 helicopters, and 290 transport 
aircraft.  While the limits of the regime’s ballistic missile program are unknown, North Korea is 
thought to have fewer than 100 short-range missiles and fewer than 100 medium to long-range 
missiles.36 However, in recent years, North Korea has suffered oil,37 fuel,38 electricity,39 and food40 
shortages. Without aid from another entity, the regime does not have sufficient resources to 
maintain and sustain the majority of its weapons and associated personnel for rapid deployment 
or prolonged combat.  
 
Tension and change on the Korean Peninsula 

Tension between North and South Korea has continued well past the armistice meant to end the 
Korean War. Neither nation recognizes the other as a legitimate state. South Korea’s constitution 
legally defines South Korean territory as the entire Korean peninsula and its adjacent islands, with 
“North Korea” being a part of South Korea. 41 North Korea also claims to be the sole government 
of the Korean Peninsula.42 Each country’s claim of sovereignty and refusal to acknowledge the 
other as a legitimate state creates the condition for perpetual conflict. North Korea’s negative 
sentiment towards the U.S. stems from two major factors: the U.S. – South Korea military alliance 
and North Korea’s perception that the U.S. is imperialistic and prone to exploitative capitalism.43

In recent years, two primary factors have heavily influenced the current state of North Korea’s 
relations with South Korea and her allies: the rise of the regime’s leader Kim Jong Un and the 
inauguration of South Korean president Park Guen Hye. Kim Jong Un officially rose to power in 
April 2012, following the death of his father Kim Jong Il in December 2011. While his age 
remained a mystery for quite some time, it was later revealed that he was born in January 1983, 
making him age 31 at present. This makes Kim Jong Un the world’s youngest leader of an 
established nation.44 The young leader’s rise to power brought about several changes in North 
Korea. First, Kim Jong Un’s personal life is more public and more extravagant than that of his 
father. Unlike his father, the young Kim is often accompanied by his wife when making public 
appearances.45 Second, the young Kim, who is more high-tech than his predecessor, is reported to 
have an affinity for luxury items46 and is an avid gamer and basketball fan.47 Third, Kim Jong Un is 
more totalitarian than his father. Following his rise to power, the regime reportedly expanded its 
labor camps, and more military resources were allocated to target those attempting to defect. 
Kim also executed his own uncle, a high-ranking official who did not share his ideals. These moves 
indicate the regime’s priority to deter internal destabilization and dissent, which is perceived to be 
a greater threat than outside adversity. According to Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at 
Human Rights Watch, “The government now recognizes that the accounts of escaping North 
Koreans reveal Pyongyang’s crimes – so it is doing what it can to stop people from fleeing.”48 
Under Kim Jong Un’s rule, the regime has stepped up its nuclear materials production, and the 
propaganda distributed by state media has become more menacing.49  
 
The regime’s response to perceived threats has also become more volatile. Christian Whiton, a 
former deputy envoy to North Korea, noted that following Kim Jong Un’s rise to power, “the 
regime still acts in a very belligerent manner, but it seems less predictable, and more random.” 
Ellen Kim, assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies, assessed the situation thusly: “Since [Kim Jong Un] took power he has purged almost all 
of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces. We are in a situation where we 
are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions, which 
is why the current situation with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than before.”50 The regime’s 
recent reaction to an upcoming film supports these statements. The plot for the comedy film “The 
Interview” follows two talk show hosts who are asked to assassinate Kim Jong Un. The regime 
even sent a complaint about the movie to the UN.51  In response to the film, a North Korean official 
stated, “The enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt 
the dignity of the supreme leadership.” The official referred to the movie as "the most undisguised 
terrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the DPRK of their 
mental mainstay and bring down its social system.” The official also issued a threat: “If the U.S. 
administration connives at and patronizes the screening of the film, it will invite a strong and 
merciless countermeasure.”52 This reaction demonstrates North Korea’s priority of preserving the

regime’s self-perceived dignity in the global arena and its intolerance of any disrespect directed at 
the Kim family.  
 
While tensions between North and South Korea have persisted since the Korean War, these 
tensions escalated following the 2013 inauguration of South Korea’s current president, Park Geun 
Hye. Her platform, in her words, is as follows: “North Korea must keep its agreements made with 
South Korea and the international community to establish a minimum level of trust, and second 
there must be assured consequences for actions that breach the peace. To ensure stability, 
trustpolitik should be applied consistently from issue to issue based on verifiable actions, and 
steps should not be taken for mere political expediency.”53 Shortly after Park’s inauguration, 
North Korea denounced UN Security Council Resolution 2094, which is “a resolution strengthening 
and expanding the scope of United Nations sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea by targeting the illicit activities of diplomatic personnel, transfers of bulk cash, and the 
country’s banking relationships, in response to that country’s third nuclear test on 12 February 
[2013].”54  North Korea also responded strongly to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises in 
March 2013, as is noted later in this paper.55  
 
 
North Korean cyber capabilities and limitations 

North Korean infrastructure  

North Korea’s cyber infrastructure is divided into two major parts: an outward-facing Internet 
connection and a regime-controlled intranet. North Korea’s outward-facing Internet connection is 
only available to select individuals and is closely monitored for any activity that is deemed anti-
regime. Individuals using the outward-facing Internet connection must be authorized. In 2013, 
Jean H. Lee, the Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang, stated that foreigners visiting North 
Korea are allowed Internet access with no firewalls.56  Common citizens are limited to using the 
Kwangmyong (gwang me-young), a nationwide intranet with no access to the world outside North 
Korea. 57 According to Lee, Kwangmyong allows citizens “access to the state media, information 
sources that are vetted by the government, and picked and pulled from the Internet and posted to 
their intranet site.”58 As of May 2013, North Korea had only one “Internet café.”59 A 2003 report 
from the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive stated that North Korea’s “Internet 
café” was “the only place in North Korea for the public to access the Internet” and that foreigners 
were allowed to access the Internet from this café.60 Whether citizens are allowed to access the 
Internet from this location is unknown.  
 
Star Joint Venture Co. is responsible for providing North Korea’s Internet access. Star Joint Venture 
Co. was established by the Post and Telecommunications Corporation in cooperation with Loxley

Pacific in Thailand.61 In December 2009, Star Joint Venture became responsible for North Korea’s 
Internet address allocation. Previously, Internet access was provided by a German satellite link via 
Korea Computer Center Europe or via direct connections with China Netcom, which was later 
merged into China Unicom. 62 By October 2010, North Korea had made its first known direct 
connection to the Internet, hosting an outward-facing Korean Central News Agency website 
accessible from the global Internet. 63 However, many of North Korea’s globally accessible 
websites are hosted in other countries.  In 2001, South Korean reports indicated that North Korea 
had joined the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).64 As of April 
2012, North Korea reportedly used the Intelsat connection, which appeared in border gateway 
protocol (BGP) announcements.65 Some reports referred to the Intelsat connection as North 
Korea’s backup Internet connection, in case the China Unicom connection fails.66 A March 2013 
post on the blog rdns.im showed that North Korea no longer used the Intelsat connection. In the 
blog post, the author noted his method for proving that The Pirate Bay was not hosted in North 
Korea. While his analysis of The Pirate Bay’s hosting is irrelevant to our research, he did detail that 
175.45.177.0/24 always routes through AS4837, and AS131279. AS131279 is Star-KP, North 
Korea’s Star Joint Venture Company, and AS4837 is China Unicom. The author concluded that “all 
[traffic] is ONLY routed through China Unicom and NOT through Intelsat.”67 In February 2014, 
North Korean and South Korean officials agreed to extend Internet access to Kaesong Industrial 
Zone, a jointly operated industrial complex just north of the border. However, this would likely 
require a major electrical and network infrastructure expansion.68 
 
North Korea’s electrical grid cannot support a large technological infrastructure.69  Electrical 
power is reported to be unreliable and sporadic, with many citizens only receiving a few hours of 
electricity per day.70

The photo above (Figure 3), from the International Space Station, shows North Korea’s sparse 
power grid, in comparison with surrounding nations.71 We have highlighted North Korea in red.  
 
Koryolink, the country’s only cellular phone network,72 is tightly controlled by the regime.73 Cell 
phone data plans are not available to most users.  Most cellular phones cannot access the 
Internet and can only make domestic calls.74 According to a 2013 report, North Korea has a 3G 
data network for cellular phones.  Visiting reporter Jean H. Lee purportedly used this 3G network 
to post to both Twitter and Instagram. However, citizens are not generally allowed to use the 3G 
network.75  
 
Email is also regulated by the regime. The first email provider in North Korea was Silibank. Silibank 
has servers in Pyongyong and Shenyang and is a joint venture with China. The North Korean 
Silibank homepage is silibank.net, and the Chinese homepage is silibank.com. In order to use the 
email service, users had to initially register, provide personal information, and pay a registration 
fee and monthly service fees.76 This registration information was current as of 2001. However, it 
is unknown whether the same process still applies.  
 
WHOIS records for silibank.net show that the site was registered anonymously via a Japanese 
registrar. This information can be found in Appendix A at the end of this paper.

Korea Computer Center (KCC) is North Korea’s leading government research center for 
information technology. KCC has eleven regional information centers and eight development and 
production centers. Other countries with KCC branch offices include China, Syria, Germany, and 
United Arab Emirates.  KCC has a vested interest in Linux research and is responsible for the 
development of North Korea’s national operating system, Red Star OS, which is discussed in more 
detail below. KCC’s other projects have included a proprietary search engine, a document writer, a 
game called Jang-Gi, the Kwangmyong intranet, a food study program, a Korean input method 
editor, a pen-based English-Korean and Korean-English translator, Korean voice recognition 
software, a video conferencing system, a distance education system, SilverStar Paduk software, 
HMS Player77, and the Samjiyon tablet. 78 In addition to research and development, KCC also 
monitors websites of foreign government and business entities and conducts technical 
reconnaissance to blueprint the technical specifications and vulnerabilities in foreign systems and 
technologies. KCC has also been involved in clandestine information and cyber operations, serving 
as a command center.79 
 
North Korea’s proprietary operating system is Red Star OS. The development of this Linux-based 
operating system started in 2002. Red Star OS is only offered in the Korean language and 
features proprietary software including Naenara (a Firefox-based browser), as well as a text 
editor, email client, audio and video players, and games.80 Red Star OS’s keyboard layouts include 
Korean, English, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese. Regime ideals extend to Red Star OS. The 
readme file, which goes with the installation disc, reportedly includes a quote from Kim Jong-Il 
regarding the importance of North Korea having its own Linux-based operating system that is 
compatible with Korean traditions. While prior versions of Red Star were KDE-based, version 3.0 
mimics Apple’s OS X.81 82 This could indicate the regime leader Kim Jong Un’s preference for the 
OS X environment, as Kim reportedly uses an iMac.83 Citizens do not need permission to obtain 
Red Star OS. However, the purchase of computers is heavily regulated.84 The OS’s design suggests 
it was developed with means for the regime to monitor user activity.85 
  
North Korea is known to use two IP ranges. 175.45.176.0/22 is North Korea’s own IP block.86 
Additionally, North Korea’s Telecommunications Ministry is the registered user of China Unicom IP 
range 210.52.109.0/24.87 The country’s only autonomous system (AS) number is AS131279, and 
its only peer is AS4837, the AS for China Unicom.88 
 
North Korea’s country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is .kp. In 2007, the .kp TLD was initially 
delegated to and administered by the German-based KCC Europe.89 After KCC Europe failed to

Various U.S., U.N, and other sanctions prohibit export of dual-use technologies to North Korea. In 
light of this, North Korea has managed to develop both hardware and software and hosts an 
annual National Exhibition of Invention and New Technologies to promote its products.92 However, 
the regime has historically failed in its attempts at large-scale production of electronic 
components. The country’s sparse electrical grid is one of the major obstacles hindering large-
scale manufacturing.93 Additionally, the famine in the early 1990’s negatively impacted existing 
manufacturing facilities, and the regime simply does not have the capital to modernize those 
factories.94 A member of the World International Property Organization (WIPO), North Korea joined 
the WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty that protects patents and trademarks worldwide, and 
leverages intellectual property laws to ensure Westerners do not take credit for North Korean 
inventions.95 The regime, in its efforts to isolate its citizens from Western influence, leverages 
intellectual property laws to ensure Westerners do not take credit for North Korean inventions.96 
This is ironic since foreign-made electronic components are sometimes smuggled into North 
Korea for military use and for personal use by the regime’s upper echelon.  
 
An analysis of developments in North Korean cyberspace since 2010 

A comparison of a scan97 of North Korea’s IP ranges in November 2010, just one month after 
North Korea made its first direct connection to the Internet, and a series of several scans we 
conducted in May 2014, shows that North Korea has made significant headway in establishing its 
Internet presence.  
 
In the November 2010 scan, 175.45.176.0 - 175.45.176.16 showed a variety of devices including 
D-link, Cisco, Linksys, HP, and Nokia devices, and a Juniper networks firewall. Operating systems 
detected included FreeBSD 6.x, Linux 2.6.x, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 175.45.176.14 returned 
“Naenara” as an html-title. Most hosts in the 175.45.176.xx and 175.45.177.xx ranges were 
down.  As of 2014, IP addresses 175.45.176.0 - 175.45.177.255 appear to be used for websites, 
nameservers, databases, email, and voice over IP (VoIP).  In November 2010, the 175.45.178.xx 
range showed all hosts down,98 and the 175.45.179.xx range showed most hosts were down.99

In 2014, several webservers and nameservers were found in the 175.45.178.xx range, and 
several nameservers and mail servers were found in the 175.45.179.xx range. This comparison 
demonstrates that there has been some growth in DPRK Internet infrastructure over the past four 
years. However, it seemingly lags behind even most third world nations. The 2014 scans detected 
dated technology that is potentially susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities and consistently 
showed the same open ports and active devices on scanned hosts. It is not clear whether the 
regime failed to notice and react to the scanning or whether the regime allows these open ports 
and devices to be detected or spoofed to serve as a distraction or possible honeypot.  
 
Domains, nameservers, and mail servers present during the May 2014 scan are listed in Appendix 
B at the end of this report. 
 
According to Alexa rankings, the three most visited websites in North Korea are kcna.kp, the

North Korean cyber war and intelligence structure  

At the top of North Korea’s military structure is the National Defense Commission (NDC). The NDC 
is also the highest branch of government and the regime’s supreme policymaking body. 111  Along 
with the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the Cabinet, NDC is at the top of

111 https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/dprk-security-apparatus/national-defense-commission/ 

North Korea’s political hierarchy.112 Article 106 of North Korea’s Constitution gives the NDC the 
following powers:113 

  The power to establish policies of the state in accordance with the military-first 

revolutionary line. 

  The power to guide the armed forces and oversee defense building. 
  The power to supervise and ensure the NDC and its chairman’s orders are executed and to 

establish necessary measures. 

  The power to override any state decisions or directives that are in opposition to the NDC 

or its chairman’s decisions and directives. 

  The power to create or remove central organs of the national defense sector. 
  The power to create and bestow military titles above general-grade officer rank. 

 
The NDC oversees several defense and intelligence bodies including the Ministry of State Security, 
the Ministry of People’s Security, the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces, and the Korean People’s 
Army. The Ministry of State Security (MSS), also known as the State Security Department, is North 
Korea’s primary counterintelligence service. It is considered an autonomous agent of the regime 
and reports directly to leader Kim Jong Un. The MSS’s duties include oversight of North Korean 
prison camps, investigation of domestic espionage, repatriation of defectors, and overseas 
counterespionage operations.114 The Ministry of People’s Security is also known as the Ministry of 
Public Security (MPS). Focused on domestic order, it oversees North Korea’s national police force, 
conducts criminal investigations and preliminary examinations, and oversees correctional 
facilities, excluding prison camps.115  While the roles of the MSS and MPS focus more on 
intelligence than on cyber operations, the MSS also reportedly has a communications monitoring 
and computer hacking group.116 
 
The Ministry of People’s Armed Forces (MPAF) administrates the Korean People’s Army (KPA) and 
oversees the General Staff Department (GSD), which is responsible for 
operational command and control of North Korea’s armed forces. The General 
Staff Department also oversees the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), North 
Korea’s agency for clandestine operations. The RGB has a role in both traditional 
and cyber operations. In the past, the RGB has sent agents on overseas military 
assistance missions to train insurgent groups.117 The RGB reportedly has a special 
operations forces (SOF) element118 and oversees six bureaus that specialize in 
operations, reconnaissance, technology and cyber matters, overseas intelligence 
collection, inter-Korean talks, and service support.119 Two of these bureaus have 
been identified as the No. 91 Office and Unit 121.  The No. 91 Office, an office 
responsible for hacking, operates out of the Mangkyungdae-district of 

Unit 121 comprises both an 
intelligence component and 
an attack component. One of 
Unit 121’s command posts is 
Chilbosan Hotel in Shenyang, 
China. Unit 121 maintains 
technical reconnaissance 
teams responsible for 
infiltration of computer 
networks, hacking to obtain 
intelligence, and planting 
viruses on enemy networks.

Pyongyang.120 Unit 121 comprises both an intelligence component and an attack component. Unit 
121’s headquarters is in the Moonshin-dong area of Pyongyang, near the Taedong River.121 It also 
has components that conduct operations from within China. One of Unit 121’s command posts is 
Chilbosan Hotel122 in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province, which borders North Korea.123 
Shenyang is a Chinese military district.124 According to Dr. Alexandre Mansourov, an expert on 
North Korea and a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, "They 
[Unit 121] are believed to have conducted hacking operations from inside China that falsify

as Lab 110 are reported to maintain technical reconnaissance teams responsible for infiltrating 
computer networks, hacking to obtain intelligence, and planting viruses on enemy networks.126 127

Several entities are nested under the Workers’ Party. The Central Party 
Committee oversees the Central Party Investigative Group, also known as Unit 
35.130 Unit 35 is reportedly responsible for technical education and training of 
cyber warriors.131 The Unification Bureau’s132 Operations Department is 
responsible for cyber-psychological warfare, organizational espionage, and 
oversight of Unit 204. Unit 204’s responsibilities include planning and execution 
of cyber-psychological warfare operations and technological research. The 
Psychological Operations Department of the North Korea Defense Commission 
also engages in cyber-psychological warfare.133 The 225th Bureau, or Office 225, 
is responsible for training agents, infiltration operations in South Korea, and 
creation of underground political parties in order to incite disorder and revolution. 
It plays a more traditional intelligence and psychological operations role, rather 
than focusing on cyber operations.134 The United Front Department (UFD) 
conducts overt operations to create pro-North Korean groups in South Korea. 
Examples of this activity include the Korean Asia-Pacific Committee and the 
Ethnic Reconciliation Council. The UFD also manages inter-Korean dialogue and North Korea’s 
policy toward South Korea. Its operations are also more traditional rather than cyber-focused.135

The Liaison Department of the Worker’s Party oversees a faction of ethnic North Koreans residing 
in Japan who are critical to North Korea’s cyber and intelligence programs. This group, which was 
established in 1955, is referred to by various names including the Chosen Soren, Chongryon, and 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan.136 The Chongryon ascribe to juche and seek 
to preserve North Korean culture while living in Japan. They operate North Korean style schools 
and refuse to assimilate with Japanese culture.137 According to Mitsuhiro Suganuma, former 
section head of the second intelligence department of the Japanese Public Security Intelligence 
Agency (PSIA),  “Chongryon is virtually under the direct control of the Liaison Department of the 
Workers’ Party of Korea, which has been in charge of North Korea’s covert operations and 
underground activities against South Korea. Chongryon in Japan has been a strong support 
organization aimed at bringing a revolution in South Korea, or a red unification by force.” He also 
stated “North Korea will continue to make Chongryon serve as Pyongyang’s pawn in covert 
operations against South Korea.”138 The Chongryon are vital to North Korea’s military budget, 
raising funds via weapons trafficking, drug trafficking, and other black market activities.139  The 
group also forms “front companies” abroad that benefit the regime by generating 
hard currency. One example is Unikotech, which was formed to sell KCC products 
abroad. 140 The Chongryon’s underground group known as the Gakushu-gumi, or 
“the study group”, gathers intelligence for North Korea and helps the regime 
procure advanced technologies.141 The Chongryon’s role in North Korean 
intelligence and resource acquisition is discussed below in more detail. 
 
The regime also has several government bodies under the Cabinet142 that oversee 
its infrastructure, intelligence, and technological development. These include the 
Central Scientific and Technological Information Agency (CSTIA), the Ministry of Electronics 
Industry, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The CSTIA collects, analyzes, and 
processes data regarding advanced science and technology then sends relevant information to 
appropriate areas of the national economy.143  The amount of information contained in CSTIA's 
technical database makes it North Korea's largest scientific facility. According to a CIA article, 
review of CSTIA’s publications showed that China, Russia, and Japan are important sources of 
technical data.  CSTIA’s publications include newsletters and an 18-volume science and 
technology reference series.144  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is the body of 
oversight for Star Joint Venture Co.145

North Korea’s cyber doctrine, strategies and goals  

 

 

 

 

 

North Korea’s cyber warfare doctrine has not been clearly stated. However, based on cultural and 
technical observations, we may deduce that North Korea’s cyber doctrine follows the tenets of 
juche nationalism and the songun doctrine.  
 
Although North Korea’s limited online presence makes a thorough analysis of their cyber warfare 
capabilities a difficult task, it must be noted that what is known of those capabilities closely 
mirrors their kinetic warfare tactics. Cyber warfare is simply the modern chapter in North Korea’s 
long history of asymmetrical warfare. North Korea has used various unconventional tactics in the 

past, such as guerilla warfare, strategic use of terrain, and psychological operations.146 The 
regime also aspires to create viable nuclear weapons.147 Asymmetrical warfare is defined as “a 
conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact 
and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve 
strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the ‘weaker’ combatants attempting to use 
strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality”. 148   
 
According to the aforementioned report to the House Armed Service Committee, “Cyber warfare is 
an important asymmetric dimension of conflict that North Korea will probably continue to 
emphasize — in part because of its deniability and low relative costs.”149 North Korea’s poor 
economic state150, further explains the regime’s reliance on these tactics.  In 2014, the regime 
reportedly spent 16% of its budget on defense.151 The North Korean military places a strong 
emphasis on information warfare capabilities including political and psychological warfare152 and 
cyber or hacker warfare.153 
 
The report by Capt. Duk-Ki Kim, Ph.D. highlighted North Korea’s counter-asymmetric strategy and 
ranked each based on intensity and frequency:

Cyber warfare operations 

 

Just ten years ago, experts noted that North Korea was one of the “least network-ready and most 
isolated societies on the planet.”155 Today North Korea’s air-gapped networks and prioritization of 
resources for military use provide both a secure and structured base of operations for cyber 
operations and a secure means of communications.156 North Korea’s hermit infrastructure creates

a cyber-terrain that deters reconnaissance. Because North Korea has few Internet connections to 
the outside world, anyone seeking intelligence on North Korea’s networks has to expend more 
resources for cyber reconnaissance.157 A 2003 article by the U.S. Office of the National 
Counterintelligence Executive assessed that “Development of the nation, rather than 
empowerment of the individual, appears to be driving DPRK efforts to develop domestic IT 
infrastructure and industry.”158 In November 2013, Kim Jong Un referred to cyber warfare 
capabilities as a “magic weapon” in conjunction with nuclear weapons and missiles.159  
 
According to Kim Heung-kwang, a North Korean defector and former computer science professor, 
the regime has the following motivations for expanding its cyber warfare capabilities:160 
 

  Cyber capabilities are a cost-effective way to offset North Korea’s lack of kinetic military 

prowess. 

  North Korea’s school systems place a strong emphasis on math, giving the nation 

 

confidence in its programmers, cryptographers, and security researchers. 
In the modern warfare landscape, cyber capabilities are potentially more utilitarian than 
heavy artillery or aircraft. 

  Cyber warfare capabilities provide a platform for espionage, psychological operations, 

and other forms of non-kinetic warfare. 

  Considering the separatist nature of North Korea’s infrastructure, cyber warfare provides 

a strategic advantage since outbound attacks are possible, but inbound attacks would 
have limited reach. 

  Cyber warfare allows North Korea to leverage the Internet’s inherent flaws for offensive 

purposes while maintaining its defenses, primarily via air-gapping its most critical 
networks from the outside world. 

 
North Korea’s attack and defense capabilities reportedly include the following cyber warfare and 
electronic warfare components: offensive cyber operations (OCO); computer network operations 
(CNO), which includes both computer network attack (CNA) and computer network exploitation 
(CNE); distributed denial of service (DDoS);161 satellite monitoring; drones; GPS jamming 
capabilities162; and deployment of electromagnetic pulse (EMP).163 North Korea’s OCO and CNO 
capabilities became apparent as early as 2004, when North Korea reportedly gained access to 33 
of 80 South Korean military wireless communication networks. In June 2006, an attack on the U.S. 
State Department originating in the East Asia-Pacific region coincided with U.S.-North Korea 
negotiations over the regime’s nuclear missile testing.164 A month later, a South Korean military 
report implicated North Korea’s Unit 121 in hacking the South Korean and U.S. Defense 
Departments. North Korea also tested a logic bomb in October 2007. A logic bomb is malicious

code programmed to execute based on a pre-defined triggering event. Following the logic bomb 
test, the UN passed a resolution banning sales of certain computer hardware to North Korea.165  
 
North Korea considers its cyber warfare capabilities an important asymmetric asset in the face of 
its perceived enemies, the U.S. and South Korea. While North Korea does not have an immersive 
digital culture, both the U.S. and South Korea are heavily dependent upon technological 
infrastructure for social, economic, and political stability.166 For this reason, a cyber attack that 
cripples or compromises the reliability of the U.S. or South Korea’s technological infrastructure 
could have a far-reaching impact. 
 
 
Gaming for profit and pwnage 

North Korea has used 
computer games for both 
illegal capital gain and 
orchestrating cyber attacks. 

North Korea has reportedly used computer games for both illegal capital gain and 
orchestrating cyber attacks. In 2011, South Korean police arrested five individuals, 
including one Chinese national, for allegedly collaborating with North Korean hackers 
affiliated with the Korea Computer Center to steal money via online games.167  
According to South Korean reports, the culprits used an auto-player to quickly 
progress in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) “Lineage” and were 
able to use the game’s market to obtain real currency.168 In 2013, South Korean officials released 
information stating they had found evidence that North Korea was using games as a medium for 
infecting machines and launching cyber attacks. North Korea had used game downloads to infect 
100,000 South Korean machines for a botnet used to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attack against Incheon Airport.169 This clever tactic sought to leverage a seemingly innocent game 
as a force multiplier in order to amplify the effects of a DDoS attack on a critical infrastructure 
target. However, in this case, there was little impact on the target. 
 
Intelligence and counterintelligence 

North Korea’s intelligence program is one of its strongest military assets, providing foundational 
support for all other military operations. The regime’s cyber warfare capabilities, in particular, rely 
heavily on open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection and cyber-espionage. 170 As noted in a CIA 
publication, "It is a significant irony of our information age that open-source intelligence is 
contributing to the survival and development of one of the world's most secretive regimes."171 
Historically, the primary goals of the regime’s intelligence program included collection and 
dissemination of intelligence concerning any possible political, military, or economic threat to the 
regime’s security and stability. Secondary goals have included "acquisition of foreign military and 
civilian technologies and equipment, support of the DPRK’s foreign policy goals, training and

support for foreign revolutionary and terrorist organizations, and the acquisition of foreign capital 
for state and intelligence operations."172 
 
North Korea has a broad reach for intelligence collection, which extends to cyber intelligence.173  
In April 2013, Solutionary, a company providing managed security services, reported a marked 
increase in both overt attacks and information gathering attempts originating from 
North Korean IPs. Solutionary refers to any overt external attacks on company 
networks or attempts to steal data as "touches.” They reportedly recorded 12,473 of 
these touches in February 2013, 11,000 of which were directed at a single financial 
institution. As a baseline, Solutionary noted that typically only 200 incidents per 
month are traced to North Korean origin.174 This is an interesting claim, considering 
that attacks attributed to North Korea are usually routed through other countries. 
 
As mentioned above, a faction of ethnic North Koreans residing in Japan, known as the Chongryon, 
are critical to North Korea’s cyber and intelligence programs and help generate hard currency for 
the regime.  The Chongryon headquarters has been recognized as the de facto North Korean 
embassy in Japan. In 2012, the organization’s headquarters was seized to pay for the group’s 
past due debts.175

It was then purchased by a monk named Ekan Ikeguchi, who let the Chongryon continue to use 
the building in what he referred to as a “goodwill gesture”. Ikeguchi is one of the Chongryon‘s 
many ties to organized crime. Ikeguchi was arrested in the past for an attempted coup against the 
Japanese government. He also has ties to the political group Nihon Seinensya, which is involved in 
illegal activities in conjunction with the yakuza syndicate Sumiyoshi-kai, which imports and sells 
amphetamines made in North Korea.177 North Korea also has black market ties to Sumiyoshi-kai’s 
rival syndicate, Yamaguchi-gumi. Many members of the Kodo-kai, Yamaguchi-gumi’s ruling 
faction, are Korean-Japanese, with ties to North Korea.178 Masahiro Namikawa, leader of the drug 
trafficking Seido-kai yakuza organization, also has ties to the Chongryon.179 
 
The Chongryon operate at least two websites, chongryon.com, which is in Japanese, and korea-
np.co.jp. 
 
WHOIS records for chongryon.com indicate that it was registered by “guanin o” using the email 
address park2@mac.com.  The WHOIS information for korea-np.co.jp. shows that it was 
registered by Choson Shinbo Company Inc. The WHOIS records for these sites can be found in 
Appendix A. 
 
Additionally, the Chongryon operate a ferry called the Mangyongbong-92, the only direct transit 
from Japan to North Korea. In 2003, they were suspected of using the ferry to smuggle missile 
parts.180 In 2006, the ferry was temporarily banned from Japanese waters when Japanese officials 
discovered the Chongryon were using it to smuggle dual-use electronics to North Korea to be 
used for military purposes.181  
 
North Korea has a global network of state-run businesses located in 30 to 40 
countries that is used for espionage activities. The Reconnaissance General Bureau 
is responsible for oversight of this network.182 The businesses include cafes and 
other non-suspect establishments. The highest concentration of these is in China. 
Members of this espionage network reportedly “send more than $100 million in 
cash per year to the regime and provide cover for spies.”183 These establishments 
are also used for money laundering and drug trafficking.184 
 
The regime is also known to kidnap foreign citizens and use them as instruments 
for intelligence. Prisoners are first tortured and psychologically conditioned to bend to the 
regime’s will. They are then used based on their skillset. This may include teaching their language 
to North Koreans, spreading propaganda in their native language, providing translation services,

conducting military training, or other skills the regime deems useful.185 In July 2014, Japanese 
officials agreed to lift some sanctions on North Korea when the regime agreed to investigate the 
whereabouts of Japanese citizens who were allegedly abducted by North Korean agents decades 
ago. Sanctions to be lifted include the ban on port calls to Japan by North Korean ships.186 
 
North Korea has also infiltrated important positions in South Korea for both intelligence and 
psychological operations purposes.187 In 2011, South Korea’s National Intelligence 
Service reportedly discovered the presence of Communist spies. These spies within their trusted 
circles had been reporting back to North Korea for almost 10 years. The embedded spies included 
a Democratic Party representative. According to the agency, the spies were on a mission to 
infiltrate and influence the Democratic Party and to gather military intelligence.188 The regime also 
attempts to infiltrate organizations made up of North Koreans who seek shelter in South Korea, in 
order to gain intelligence. In the past several years, South Korea has arrested at least 14 defectors 
who were found to be spies.189 
 
These intelligence collection and counterintelligence capabilities are an attempt to provide the 
regime with a strategic asymmetrical advantage. The regime leverages its human and cyber 
resources around the globe to provide an influx of intelligence, while very little credible 
intelligence about the regime’s activities and capabilities ever becomes available to the outside 
world. 
 
 
Psychological operations 

North Korea continues to be a master of propaganda and deception and leverages the cyber 
realm for psychological operations. Modern North Korean psychological operations tactics include 
distribution of propaganda via traditional media outlets, websites, and social media. Many of 
these psychological operations campaigns are politically focused.190 According to Dr. Andrei 
Lankov, the North Korean government has “very rational and highly successful manipulators who 
usually get what they want by outsmarting everybody else in the process.”191 
 
The regime’s Unit 204 is responsible for cyber-psychological operations. These 
operations are PSYOP tailored for the cyber arena.  In order to be successful, cyber-
psychological campaigns require speed, precision, and creativity. These campaigns 
leverage the phenomenon of viral, unverified news stories that tend to rapidly 
propagate via social media, mobile text messaging, and other electronic 
communications. This phenomenon creates an arena for strategic propagation of both 
fact and fiction for the purposes of sentiment manipulation. Such messages may be used for 

Such messages can be 
used for recruitment, 
cyber mobilization, and to 
instill fear in a target 
population.

operations may also include mental suggestion using technology as a delivery mechanism for 
subliminal cues. It is unknown whether North Korea possesses this capability.192

North Korean propaganda208 is used for several purposes: to enforce the ideals of allies 
and sympathizers, to frame North Korea in a favorable light to outsiders, to 
sensationalize the regime’s perceived self-reliance and military prowess, and to shield its 
own citizens from the outside world.209  Juche ideology and indoctrination of the regime’s 
youth ensure support of the local population. North Koreans accept military duty as an 
honor and strive to excel in their service to the regime.  In the spirit of juche, the regime 
uses disinformation to “hide lapses or tout accomplishments that may have never been

achieved.”210 Limiting citizen access to the outside world by instituting the Kwangmyong intranet, 
North Korea ensures its citizens are not exposed to outside information that is counterproductive 
to citizen indoctrination or in conflict with juche ideals. North Korea portrays the West, particularly 
the United States, as an enemy. The regime uses this strategy of shifting the population’s 
negative sentiments toward an external entity to keep its citizens ignorant of North Korea’s own 
economic hardship, regime brutality, and systemic incompetence.211 For example, prior to Kim 
Jong Il’s death in 2011, North Korean media altered photos of their “Dear Leader” to make him 
appear younger and healthier than he really was. This became obvious when the altered photos 
were compared to those taken by Western media around the same time.212  
 
According to Dr. Andrei Lankov, “North Koreans now have a much better understanding of what is 
going on in the outside than they did before. This is largely thanks to the spread of DVDs and 
video content in the country, but also because some of them have been to China and talk about 
what they have seen…many [of] them sincerely believe that the United States remains ready to 
attack at any moment and that Japan is an incurably aggressive place…nearly all of them swallow 
the official propaganda myths about the Korean War being started by the 'American Imperialists' 
who invaded them. Hence, they see the outside world as an inherently dangerous place.”213 Some 
human rights groups seek to reach out to North Korean citizens and break them from this 
isolation. In August 2014, the New York-based charity Human Rights Foundation sponsored a 
hackathon in San Francisco called “Hack North Korea” to find new ways to get information in, out, 
and around North Korea. The event brought together many programmers, human rights 
campaigners, and defectors.214 
 
North Korea even uses “trolling” as a PSYOP tactic. On the Internet, “trolls” are users who post 
messages that are often crass, controversial, inflammatory, or offensive, in order to evoke a 
strong reaction or influence a reader’s opinion. Often, the motivation for trolling is simply for the 
troll’s enjoyment. The rude and offensive trolling tactics are in stark contrast to traditional forms 
of persuasive rhetoric. However, North Korea reportedly utilizes over 200 military intelligence 
operatives to troll South Korean message boards and social media pages with pro-North Korean 
sentiments.215 Matt Rhoades, director of the cyberspace and security program at the Truman 
National Security Project, said, "North Korea's cyber-development is almost just a new 
harassment mechanism for them, a low-cost, asymmetric method to harass its neighbor in the 
south…"216  
 
Leveraging the cyber and intelligence resources noted above, North Korea’s psychological 
operations serve an important strategic role. The ability to influence outsiders, while effectively 
isolating its own population from most outside influence, allows North Korea to remain an 
enigma. Additionally, in line with its PSYOP tactics, North Korea may strategically take credit for 
cyber attacks that were, in reality, launched by another entity. Whether the targeted entity blames

North Korea for the attacks, or the regime simply takes credit for an attack that has not yet been 
attributed, several PSYOP goals can come into play. First, to claim credit for an attack amplifies 
the impact of a show of force, particularly if South Korea is the target. This tactic can be used to 
stir sentiments in order to provoke a reaction. Second, North Korea may lay claim to responsibility 
for an attack that exceeds its capabilities in order to seem more technologically advanced and 
more capable. Third, any success, or the appearance thereof, enforces the juche ideal of regime 
self-sufficiency. Finally, North Korea may act as a scapegoat and claim credit for a cyber attack of 
an ally such as China so the attack is not attributed to the real actors.217  
 
 
Electronic warfare 

North Korea reportedly has the electronic warfare capabilities to jam GPS and to inject false GPS 
coordinates.218 North Korea demonstrated these capabilities in March 2011 by jamming South 
Korea’s GPS signals during a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise.219 North Korea has the 
capability to create an EMP.220 An EMP is a sudden, extreme outburst of atmospheric electricity 
creating an intense magnetic field that can burn out electrical equipment. 221  A report from the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) noted North Korea’s ability to deliver a nuclear 
warhead as a satellite over the South Pole, effectively creating the burst needed to deliver an EMP 
targeting the United States. An EMP could effectively disrupt electronic communications including 
critical infrastructure components such as telecommunications, financial institutions, the energy 
sector, transportation, food and water delivery, emergency services, and space systems.222 North 
Korea reportedly acquired its EMP technology from Russia.223 
 
North Korea also has a drone program. The regime reportedly acquired its first drones in the late 
1980’s or early 1990’s. The regime’s drones are complimentary to its intelligence program and 
are primarily used for surveillance.224  In early 2014 a North Korean drone crashed south of the 
38th parallel, the line dividing North Korea from the south.225 While early reports noted that the 
drones appeared similar to those manufactured by Chinese company Tauyuan Navigation Friend 
Aviation Technology, the company denied involvement.226

Stressing the importance of the regime’s electronic warfare capabilities, in 1999 former regime 
leader Kim Jong Il said “The basic key to victory in modern warfare is to do well in electronic 
warfare.”228 Since the regime’s advanced technology lags behind that of South Korea and the U.S., 
its capability to disrupt the communications of these perceived adversaries is a vital asymmetric 
capability.229 
 
 
Training cyber warriors 

North Korea utilizes primary and secondary education and the university system to train its cyber 
warfare operators. According to reports by defectors, the regime seeks out children who show 
mathematical talent and sends them through rigorous advanced training.230 A vintage North 
Korean animation stresses the importance of mathematics in North Korean education. The short 
film follows a young boy as he does his geometry homework. The frustrated boy begins to 
daydream then has visions of going to war with the U.S. and needing geometry to effectively 
calculate missile trajectory during the battle.231

The successful students are then sent to Kim Il-sung University, Kim Chaek University of 
Technology,236 or the Command Automation University, traditionally known as Mirim University.   
 
Kim Il-sung University’s computer center was started in 1985. Its computer courses have a heavy 
programming element. The university reportedly developed the Intelligent Locker hard disc 
protection program, Worluf Antivirus, SIMNA (simulation and system analysis program), a war 
games program, a hepatitis diagnosis and prescription system, and a C++ program development 
tool called FC 2.0.237 Kim Il-sung University also has programs focusing on nuclear research.238 
 
Kim Chaek University of Technology was established in 1948. In the late 1990s, it began to 
restructure its computer-focused courses to reflect more modern technologies. As of 2002, the 
university had three colleges focusing on computer science, information science and technology, 
and machine science. Software developed by the university includes Computer Fax and SGVision, 
an image-reprocessing program used for steganography.239 Students and instructors must 
submit a formal request for permission in order to use the Internet for research.240

The Command Automation University periodically chooses around 100 students for an intensive 
five-year course prior to their assignment to serve in cyber intelligence and cyber warfare 
capacities.241 Programs at the Command Automation University include command automation, 
computers, programming, automated reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.242 Other students 
attend a two-year accelerated university program, then study abroad in Russia or China before 
they are assigned to a cyber-operator role.243  
 
The elite cyber operators are given special incentives. For example, parents of students 
graduating from the cyber program with top scores are given the opportunity to live in 
Pyongyang; and married cyber operators are given housing, a food allowance, and a stipend if 
operating overseas. Due to the nature of their profession, these cyber elite are some of the only 
North Koreans allowed to access the outside Internet.244 
 
Important political and military ties 

While this report focuses on North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities, these capabilities cannot be 
fully separated from the implications of partnerships with countries known to deal in illegal 
weapons trade with the regime. Now that cyberspace has become a legitimate arena for warfare, 
these nations are also potential allies in the cyber realm. For this reason, the regime’s key political 
and military relationships are explored below. 
 
China 

North Korea has a longstanding historical relationship with China. During the Korean War (1950-
1953), China allied with North Korea’s Communist forces. China has also provided ongoing 
political and economic support to the regime’s leadership and is a primary trade partner. North 
Korea is economically dependent on China. North Korea gets an estimated 90 percent of its 
energy imports, 80 percent of its consumer goods, and 45 percent of its food supply from China. 
This relationship is prudent – in the event of a military conflict, China can strategically use North 
Korea as a buffer zone between itself and South Korea, where many U.S. military personnel are 
stationed. Chinese aid to North Korea also deters the likelihood that the regime will collapse, 
resulting in internal destabilization that could catalyze a U.S.-China conflict.245 
 
North Korea relies heavily on China for technological resources. As noted above, North Korea 
relies on China’s Unicom for Internet access.246 Additionally, the regime sends some of its cyber 
warriors to train in China247 and stations a portion of its Unit 121 personnel in Shenyang.248 Some 
of North Korea’s official websites are hosted in China, 249 and KCC has a branch office there.250

250 http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/kcc/ 

North Korea also relies on China to provide much of its network hardware, including servers and 
routers.251  
 
Russia 

North Korea has a long history of ties to Russia. The former Soviet Union was the major sponsor 
of the North Korean state and a major trading partner. Following the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, aid to North Korea was halted and trade diminished significantly. This chain of events 
contributed to North Korea’s eventual economic collapse, as it could not survive without aid.252 
 
North Korea currently has a collaborative relationship with Russia in the cyber realm. The regime’s 
CSTIA relies on Russia as one of several sources for technical data.253  North Korea also sends 
some of its cyber warriors to train in Russia,254 and the regime reportedly acquired its EMP 
technology from there.255 
 
Political ties between Russia and North Korea have become stronger in recent months. In 2014, 
potentially as a result of the U.S. response to the Russian-Ukranian conflict, Russia began to 
strengthen ties with North Korea. Negotiations reportedly included promises of trade and 
development projects. Narushige Michishita, a North Korea and Asia security expert at Japan's 
National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, stated “By strengthening its relationship with North 
Korea, Russia is trying to enhance its bargaining position vis-à-vis the United States and Japan.”256 
Russia also recently forgave most of the regime’s debts.257  
 
Iran 

North Korea and Iran have longstanding political and military ties. North Korea supplied Iran with 
conventional arms during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran and North Korea reportedly collaborate closely in 
ballistic missile development efforts. In the past, Iran provided the North Korean regime with 
necessary funds and oil in exchange for missile parts and technology. 258 259 In 2009, a North 
Korean plane transporting 35 tons of weapons and allegedly bound for Iran was seized after 
making an unscheduled stop in Bangkok, Thailand. That same year, United Arab Emirates seized a 
ship bound for Iran that was transporting several containers of North Korean weapons, including 
rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition. Reportedly, the customer was a company affiliated 
with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 260 261 
 
North Korea also has cyberwar ties with Iran. In 2012, North Korea and Iran signed a technology 
treaty to help combat “common enemies” in cyberspace. The treaty included provisions for 
cooperation in research, student exchanges, and joint laboratories. Joint projects reportedly

include IT information sharing, engineering, biotechnology, renewable energy, and sustainability. 
F-Secure’s Mikko Hypponen stated, "It's highly likely that one of the reasons for this co-operation 
is for them to work together regarding their cyber defence and cyber offense strategies". 
Hypponen cited Flame malware as a possible triggering event for the creation of this treaty. 
Others also suspect that Iran and North Korea’s mutual interest in development of nuclear 
weapons and the need to protect refineries against malware such as Stuxnet were driving factors 
in the establishment of the treaty.262 U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee leaders assert that the 
treaty indicates North Korea and Iran are collaborating on a joint nuclear weapons program.263 
 
Additionally, North Korea, in conjunction with Iran and Syria, reportedly supports both Hamas and 
Hezbollah in procuring kinetic weaponry and communications equipment and in establishing 
operational infrastructure.264 265 266 
 
Syria 

North Korea has both a cyber relationship and kinetic weapons ties with Syria. KCC reportedly has 
a branch in Syria.267  
 
In 2007, Israel launched an airstrike, destroying a Syrian target that was allegedly a nuclear facility 
under construction with North Korea’s assistance. U.S. officials noted the facility was modeled on 
the North Korean nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.268  
 
The North Korea-Syria relationship becomes more important in the context of both countries’ ties 
with Iran. As noted above, Iran, North Korea, and Syria jointly provide support to extremist groups 
Hamas and Hezbollah.269 270 271 Additionally, as we explored in HPSR Security Briefing Episode 11, 
Iran and Syria’s military alliances extend to joint SIGINT and cyber operations.272 
 
Cuba 

North Korea also has an interesting relationship with Cuba – one that includes supplying weapons 
and apparent attempts to illegally smuggle weapons. In 2013, a North Korean cargo ship on its 
return voyage was stopped near the Panama Canal. The ship was carrying surface-to-air missile 
parts, disguised as containers of sugar. In an attempt to save face, Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs stated that the cargo included "240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons -- two anti-
aircraft missile complexes Volga and Pechora, nine missiles in parts and spares, two Mig-21 Bis 
and 15 motors for this type of airplane, all of it manufactured in the mid-20th century -- to be

repaired and returned to Cuba." Experts said the cargo appeared to include a SNR-75 Fan Song 
fire-control radar system for an SA-2 missile, a Soviet-era missile system that was also used in 
Cuba.273 Following the incident, Fidel Castro credited former North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung for 
providing Cuba with weapons near the end of the Cold War. Weapons included 100,000 AK rifles 
and necessary ammunition.274 
 
While no apparent cyber relationship exists between North Korea and Cuba at this time, their track 
record for weapons trade means the potential for future collaboration in the cyber realm cannot 
be discounted.

Patterns in the noise: cyber incidents attributed to North Korean actors  

It is interesting to note that much of North Korea’s cyber activity follows a distinct pattern. 
Analysis of North Korean cyber activity gives insight into these patterns and also helps tie 
together North Korea’s strategic, tactical, and operational capabilities. Strategic capabilities refer 
to the assets used in support of a long-term, overarching goal. Tactical capabilities refer to the 
methods and maneuvers actually implemented in pursuit of the strategic goal.304 Operational 
capabilities refer to the potential use of these capabilities.305   
 
 In 2004, in response to the annual U.S. – South Korea joint military exercises, North Korea 
reportedly gained access to 33 South Korean military wireless communication networks.306 The 
next significant cyber attack attributed to North Korea was in June 2006. The U.S. State 
Department was attacked by entities in the East Asia-Pacific region. The attacks coincided with 
State Department negotiations with North Korea regarding the regime’s nuclear missile tests.307 
In July 2006, North Korea’s Unit 121 reportedly breached South Korean and U.S. military 
entities.308 This attack was concurrent with the regime’s test-fire of at least one long-range 
missile and several medium-range missiles.309  
 
2007 was politically tumultuous for North Korea. Following multi-national talks, the UN’s 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ordered the shutdown of the regime’s nuclear facilities 
in Yongbyon in July.310 Its nuclear efforts temporarily thwarted, North Korea tested a logic bomb 
in October 2007.311  
 
In April 2009, North Korea ejected IAEA and U.S. nuclear compliance officials. The regime indicated 
refusal to comply with any UN agreements regarding nuclear weaponry and announced it would 
reinstate its nuclear materials production. The next month, North Korea conducted an 
underground nuclear test and voiced its confidence that the regime was well on its way to 
producing viable nuclear technology. The UN called an emergency meeting condemning the 
nuclear weapons test, and South Korea joined the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). North 
Korea issued a statement via KCNA calling South Korea’s involvement in PSI an act of war.312 In 
June 2009, North Korea stated that it was “fully ready for any form of high-tech war.”313 The 
following month, DDoS and disk wiping malware, later known as DarkSeoul, targeted South 
Korean and U.S. government entities, media outlets, and financial websites. The attacks coincided

with U.S. Independence Day.314 315 Other malware used for Operation Troy was also planted. 
Operation Troy would continue for several years, largely undetected.316 
 
In early 2011, political and military tensions were high. In February, James Clapper, United States 
Director of National Intelligence, testified that North Korea likely had undeclared uranium 
enrichment facilities as part of its nuclear weapons program.317 In March 2011, South Korean 
media, financial, and critical infrastructure targets suffered a DDoS and disk-wiping malware 
attack later known as the “10 Days of Rain”. U.S. and South Korean military entities were also 
targeted by DDoS during this attack. The attack used the DarkSeoul malware.318 North Korea also 
disrupted South Korean GPS signals. Additionally, North Korean actors reportedly attempted a 
DDoS attack against South Korea’s Incheon Airport that same month.319 These incidents coincided 
with the annual U.S. – South Korea joint military exercises.320 The following month, North Korean 
actors reportedly launched a DDoS attack against South Korea’s Nonghyup bank.321  
 
In 2012, an attack on South Korean Newspaper JoongAng Ilbo was attributed to North Korean 
actors. This attack also coincided with the timing of the annual joint U.S. – South Korea military 
exercises.322 In September 2012, North Korea signed a cyber treaty with Iran, agreeing the two 
nations would collaborate to combat “common enemies” in cyberspace.323 
 
The week of March 11, 2013, the U.S. and South Korea began their annual joint military exercise 
near the Korean Peninsula. Like clockwork, attacks attributed to North Korea and now known as 
the March 20 attacks targeted three South Korean media outlets and Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju 
banks. North Korea also exhibited other hostile activity at that time. North Korea cut 
communication with Seoul and announced it had scrapped the 1953 armistice between the two 
Koreas. North Korea’s foreign ministry also issued a statement that it perceived this exercise as a 
precursor to invasion and that the regime would respond with a “strong military counteraction” if 
the situation escalated.324  That same week, the North Korean military conducted a drone attack 
simulation.325  
 
On March 18, the Uriminzokkiri YouTube channel posted an anti-U.S. video entitled “Firestorms 
Will Rain on the Headquarters of War” that showed a depiction of the White House in crosshairs, 
followed by an explosion.326

In May 2013, DarkSeoul malware was used to attack several South Korean financial institutions; 
and in June, DarkSeoul DDoS attacks were launched against the South Korean government’s DNS 
server. The latter took place on June 25, the anniversary of the start of the Korean War.328 
 
As evidenced above, much of North Korea’s cyber activity coincides with the annual U.S. – South 
Korea joint military exercises. Attacks not following that pattern were typically in response to 
political events impacting the regime or correlated with significant dates, such as the anniversary 
of the start of the Korean War. The regime’s strategic assets and tactical capabilities in the cyber 
arena seem to have evolved only slightly since 2009. Most of the attacks attributed to North 
Korea employ limited tactics, and their operational capability demonstrates an increase in the 
frequency and volume of attacks but is otherwise unimpressive to date. 
 
In June 2014, the regime demanded cancellation of the annual U.S. - South Korea joint military 
exercise, attempting to use participation in the upcoming Asian Games as a bargaining chip.329 The 
regime’s demands may have had other political motivations, as they preceded the July 2014 
meeting between South Korean president Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting

centered on trade and regional security issues, including the ever-present rhetoric around 
denuclearization of North Korea.330 Both leaders were critical of Japan’s recent announcement to 
soften sanctions on North Korea.331 As this report headed to press, the annual U.S. – South Korea 
joint military exercises were underway.332  
 
DarkSeoul   

According to statements 
from the South Korean 
government, North 
Korea’s Lab 110 were the 
actors behind the 
DarkSeoul malware 
attacks. 

The most prominent North Korean threat actor group is the group responsible for the DarkSeoul 
malware. According to statements from the South Korean government, North Korea’s Lab 110 
were the actors behind the DarkSeoul malware. South Korean intelligence reports 
stated that Lab 110, which is affiliated with the regime’s defense ministry, was 
ordered by the North Korean regime to destroy South Korean communications 
networks.333  Although the March 20 attacks used DarkSeoul malware, it is interesting 
to note that two groups, WhoIs Team and New Romantic Cyber Army Team, claimed 
responsibility for the “March 20” 2013 attacks on South Korean media and financial 
institutions.334  
 
Some of the DarkSeoul attacks corresponded with significant dates, such as U.S. Independence 
Day or the anniversary of the start of the Korean War. DarkSeoul attacks go beyond denial of 
service and sabotage.  As early as 2009, the group responsible for the Dark Seoul attacks 
launched “Operation Troy”, an espionage campaign targeting the South Korean military. The 
operation was codenamed “Troy” due to the frequent use of the word “Troy” in the malware’s 
compile path strings.335 The malware used in these attacks sought out and exfiltrated data, based 
on keyword searches. While the malware was clearly intended to search for and exfiltrate certain 
types of data, its true impact on the targets was never revealed. 336 The March 2011 “10 Days of 
Rain” DDoS attacks on U.S. and South Korean sites have also been attributed to the actors 
associated with DarkSeoul.337 According to Symantec, the politically motivated attacks have 
required a level of intelligence, coordination, monetary support, and technical sophistication that 
suggests state sponsorship.338 This designation means the group can be considered an advanced 
persistent threat (APT). 
 
A March 20, 2013 attack attributed to the DarkSeoul actors targeted three South Korean media 
outlets and Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju banks. The impact of the March 20 attacks included 
disruption of service at financial institutions and data deletion. However, the targeted entities 
resumed normal operations shortly thereafter.339 According to South Korean reports, the media 
outlets targeted corresponded with those listed by the North Korean regime in 2012 as right-wing 
press that manipulated South Korea’s public opinion. In April 2012, the regime reportedly listed

those entities as attack targets.340 The malware used in the March 20, 2013 attacks were wiper 
malware. The malware attempted to disable AhnLab and Hauri AV antivirus products then 
proceeded to overwrite the master boot record (MBR).  The attack was capable of wiping both 
Linux and Windows machines.341 McAfee found that these attacks were the culmination of the 
malware campaign they dubbed “Operation Troy”.342  
 
A report from IssueMakersLab tied the actors responsible for the March 20, 2013 attacks to cyber 
attack activity occurring as early as 2007. IssueMakersLab found that these actors consistently 
used the same 16-digit password for file compression, the same stage 1 C2 protocol, the same 
collection keywords and encryption keys, and the same development path.343 According to South 
Korea’s Korea Internet and Security Agency, the North Korean IP address 175.45.178.xx was 
found scanning South Korean routes the month before the attacks,344 and the same IP was 
reportedly logged as accessing one of the targets 13 times.345 Details of the March 20 attack also 
suggested possible ties to China. AlienVault suspected the Chinese exploit kit GonDad was used to 
spread the malware, and the Korean domains serving the malware were registered using a 
Chinese email address. Additionally, researchers at AhnLab in South Korea noted a Chinese IP 
address linked to the attacks.346  
 
While no concrete evidence has been released that indicates Lab 110 was responsible for the 
DarkSeoul attacks, the responsible group’s targets, TTP, and attack timing demonstrate a strong 
pro-North Korean sentiment.

WhoIs Team 

WhoIs Team is one of two groups that claimed responsibility for the “March 20” attacks targeting 
South Korea. A defacement on the LG +U webpage stated that it was “Hacked by WhoIs Team” 
and that the attackers would return. The page featured three skulls.354 However, no other attacks

Based on North Korea’s affinity for disinformation and counterintelligence, we must note the 
distinct possibility that operatives claiming to be WhoIs Team are part of another group and that 
the defacement was a false flag operation meant to pin blame on RAON_ASRT. RAON_ASRT is a 
South Korean white hat capture the flag (CTF) team, whose members also operate under the 
name “WhoIs”.357

RAON_ASRT (the RaonSecure Advanced Security Research Team) and its sub-teams WhoIs Team 
and Cpark Team359 have participated in and performed well in CTF contests such as the one 
hosted by DefCon. 360 In 2013, a member of RAON_ASRT was invited to Blue House, the residence 
of the South Korean president, to meet with president Park and discuss the security industry.361 
RAON_ASRT runs the Secuinside CTF competition.362 Their parent organization RaonSecure

RAON_ASRT WhoIs Team would maliciously target South Korean entities.  
 
IsOne 

IsOne is the group that claimed responsibility for the June 2012 attack on the website of South 
Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. The attack included an attempt to wipe JoongAng Ilbo’s servers 
as well as a defacement depicting a laughing cat. Despite efforts to wipe the target’s servers, the 
target only suffered defacement and temporary downtime.365

Although the groups have a similar name and both use a cat theme, it is unclear whether a CTF 
team known as “The Cat is Number 1” and IsOne are the same actors. “The Cat is Number 1” 
members claim to hail from North Korea, but there is no hard evidence linking team members to

another group.

According to South Korea’s National Police Agency, the attack on JoongAng Ilbo shares 
characteristics with previous attacks attributed to North Korean actors. An investigation 
conducted by the agency’s Cyber Terror Response Center found that the actors targeting 
JoongAng Ilbo used two North Korean servers and 17 servers in 10 other countries. One server 
maintained a constant connection to an IP address belonging to Joson Telecommunication 
Company, which is affiliated with North Korea’s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. 
Investigators found that one of the servers used in the attack on JoongAng Ilbo was also used in 
the March 2011 DDoS attacks on South Korean critical infrastructure sites and the April 2011 
attack on Nyongyup Bank.369

an individual actor within the group. 
 
It is interesting to note that the malware associated with these actors uses the strings “HASTATI” 
and “PRINCIPES” to overwrite the MBR. The name Hastati likely refers to a class of infantrymen of 
the early Roman Republic. The Hastati were less experienced soldiers who fought on the 
frontlines with spears and swords. Principes likely refers to more experienced Roman soldiers 
who fought on the second line of battle. 375

Malware summary 

HP researchers had previously analyzed samples of the DarkSeoul dropper, and findings were 
published in our annual HP Cyber Risk Report 2013. Analysis of this malware is included in 
Appendix C. Analysis of additional malware used in these campaigns produced no new findings 
and only corroborated what was found by external security researchers. These publicly available 
analyses have been cited throughout the report. Some of the malware samples were no longer 
publicly available. However, CrowdStrike obtained these missing samples before they 
disappeared from the wild and conducted thorough analysis, which was released in their 
subscription-only reports. While we cannot divulge detailed information from those reports, an 
overview of the findings is provided below.

The majority of the malware used in cyber incidents attributed to North Korea were variations of 
three types of malware: dropper, wiper, and IRC remote access trojan (RAT). CrowdStrike’s 
attribution of this malware to North Korean actors stemmed from two primary factors: Korean 
language characters found in the binaries and the propensity to specifically target South Korean 
entities.379 
 
Dropper samples consistently targeted AhnLab Policy Center as a propagation method. This 
information is corroborated in a Black Hat Asia 2014 presentation by Fortinet researcher Kyle 
Yang.380  CrowdStrike’s report also briefly noted the use of an update server vector.381  Yang 
analyzed the malware's update config metadata and matched its format to the AhnLab Policy 
Center. To test its payload, Yang set up a server/client and executed the update through the 
server. As Yang had predicted, it wiped the client.382 While the method for initial compromise of 
the update server is not noted in detail, CrowdStrike’s report cites “collateral information” that 
suggests targeted email attacks were used to gain initial entry, and policy servers were then 
compromised. The upload server vector included a time-based logic bomb that allowed the wiper 
to target a large number of systems, on a set time and date, with full permissions on all of the 
targeted systems.383 
 
According to CrowdStrike, the wiper malware was dropped on the systems as AgentBase.exe. The 
wiper used the Windows utility 'taskkill' to kill the processes pasvc.exe and clisvc.exe, which are 
the main processes for the Ahnlab and Hauri antivirus applications.384 385 The wiper then 
performed system reconnaissance, gathering drive information and operating system version. 
Depending on the OS used, the wiper recursively deleted files on the file system, deleting the 
Windows folder last. It then overwrote the MBR with the strings "HASTATI", "PRINCPES", 
"PRINCIPES", or "PR!NCPES”.386 
 
While there are several variants of the wiper, all seem to have been used on the same date. It is 
unclear why multiple wiper variants with slightly differing behavior were used for the same 
campaign. One possible explanation is that multiple variants were used to minimize the 
operational damage to the mission in the case of an early detection of one of the variants. For 
example, if one wiper variant was compromised or detected by antivirus or IDS signatures, the 
other variants may have differed enough to remain undetected, still resulting in mission success. 
 
According to CrowdStrike, a third malware component downloaded an IRC RAT from various 
compromised websites. This RAT is detected by Symantec as Backdoor.Prioxer. Prioxer has been 
linked to other 2011 attacks on South Korea. It is unclear whether these downloaders were

Analysis  

Based on the information above, we have identified strategic challenges that impact the 
development of North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities. We have also noted relevant 
implications:   
 

•  The North Korean regime strictly controls all Internet infrastructure,388 meaning cyber 

activity by dissidents or autonomous hacker groups are very unlikely. In other words, any 
cyber attacks originating in North Korea can be assumed to be state sponsored. For this 
reason, according to defectors, the regime’s cyber operators do not typically launch 
attacks directly from within North Korea. Instead, many regime-sponsored attacks are 
launched from cells based in China, U.S., South Asia, Europe, and even South Korea.389  
•  North Korea has a limited number of outgoing connections.390 For this reason, there is a 
low probability of DDoS originating from within. However, this does not preclude the use 
of botnets with a local C2 server or the use of networks in third-party nations to launch 
attacks. As seen in the July 2009 attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets, North Korea 
has leveraged networks in countries such as Austria, Georgia, Germany, and even South 
Korea and the U.S., in order to launch cyber attacks.391 North Korea will likely be forced to 
rely on third parties for quite some time, due to its lack of sufficient infrastructure for 
launching large-scale CNO. 

•  Several outward facing websites are hosted in China and other countries. This implies two 
possibilities: that North Korea’s infrastructure cannot handle a heavy incoming traffic load 
392 or that the regime wants to separate the propaganda crafted for an outside target 
audience from internally-focused propaganda. This arrangement seems unlikely to 
change in the foreseeable future. 

•  North Korea is known to have unstable power supplies393, which limits scalability of the 

regime’s current CNO capabilities. This is another reason why expansion of CNO 
capabilities using the nation’s own infrastructure seems unlikely in the foreseeable future. 

•  North Korea is known to have monetary deficiencies,394 which further limit expansion of 

infrastructure and CNO capabilities, at least without third-party aid. North Korea continues 
to rely heavily on China for sustainment.395 

•  Although we see few instances of overt cyber operations, that North Korea reportedly 

spends so much of its limited resources on training and equipping cyber operators speaks 
volumes. The human element of the regime’s cyber war program, at least, has potential.

•  Sanctions against North Korea and export laws prohibit the sale of certain technologies to 

the regime.396 In other words, in order to obtain the technology needed for a cyber 
warfare program, the regime must improvise. North Korea must develop its own 
technology, manufacture technology using plans obtained via industrial espionage, or rely 
on third parties to procure it for them.  However, the regime has historically failed in its 
attempts of large-scale production of electronic components.  At present, North Korea 
relies on China to provide much of its network hardware, including servers and routers.397 
It is unlikely that North Korea will compromise on its nuclear program, meaning sanctions 
will likely be longstanding, and the regime will have to continue to rely on third parties to 
procure technology. 

 
Cyber incidents attributed to North Korean actors seem to follow distinct patterns: 
 

  According to reports by other researchers, the conventions and C2 structure used by 

North Korean cyber actors show continuity and consistency over time. 

  The majority of the incidents attributed to North Korean actors consistently used wiper 

malware. 

  Several of the incidents included defacements, with a different group taking credit each 
time. Additionally, little information or attack history was found about any of the groups, 
aside from information acknowledged in this report. These factors seem to indicate that a 
single group may have been responsible for several attacks over time, using different 
group names as a false flag. 

  On more than one occasion, the malware included provisions to disable security software 

made by South Korean security company AhnLab. This detail strengthens the case that 
the malware was written or modified to specifically target South Korean machines. 
  The attacks followed an explicit pattern: most were around the time of U.S. – South 
Korean joint military exercises, while the others fell on a significant date or were in 
response to political events. 

  The primary targets were South Korean and U.S. entities. While these nations are 

traditionally targeted by the regime, it is also possible that South Korean entities are quick 
to attribute any attack on their infrastructure to North Korean actors. In fact, in some 
cases, South Korean reports were the only source of attribution. 

 
Summary 

Does North Korea have sufficient cyber infrastructure and cyber warfare capabilities to harm the 
U.S. and its allies? While North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities pale in comparison to those of 
wealthier nations, the regime has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure and in 
establishing cyber operations. The rate of this progress warrants a closer look at North Korea’s 
motivations, TTPs, and capabilities. As noted above, North Korea views the U.S. and South Korea 
as its primary adversaries. The U.S. and South Korea are high-tech nations with economies that

depend heavily on technology.398 In contrast, North Korea does not have a high tech culture. For 
these reasons, we should not overestimate the regime’s advanced cyber capability, yet we should 
never underestimate the potential impact of North Korea utilizing less advanced, quick-and-dirty 
tactics like DDoS to cripple their high-tech targets. Both government and corporate entities are 
susceptible to being targeted by North Korean cyber attacks. North Korean juche ideology places 
the survival of the regime as its primary goal, and any perceived threat to the regime may be 
targeted. Several attacks on U.S. and South Korean government, financial, and critical 
infrastructure entities have been attributed to North Korean origins..  These attacks were often 
preceded by or occurred in conjunction with North Korea voicing negative sentiments about the 
targeted entities. As we saw with Iranian cyber actors in HPSR Security Briefing Episode 11,399 
state sponsored cyber actors often launch an attack in response to a political trigger. The same 
pattern seems to apply to pro-North Korean cyber actors, who have launched attacks to coincide 
with U.S. Independence Day and the anniversary of the start of the Korean War, as well as 
propaganda and cyber attacks in response to joint military exercises between the U.S. and South 
Korea.400 401 
 
As shown by North Korea's past behavior (which is consistent with their doctrine), they are easily 
"pushed into a corner".  At the slightest perceived threat, the regime responds with saber-rattling 
and peacocking. The regime is extremely defensive and will, in turn, flex its muscles to show the 
world how capable it is, even if this is an inaccurate display of their overall capabilities.  
 
The regime fears losing its control and the nation’s culture to the ever-growing threat of outside 
influence, as is evidenced in the regime’s reaction to the comedy film “The Interview”. The regime 
has represented itself to its citizens as a powerful and capable entity and has used this status to 
control the populace. For this reason, the regime’s leaders are forced to continually demonstrate 
this strength and power, or an illusion thereof, both domestically and globally, in order to 
maintain the status needed to ensure continued suppression of the population. This show of 
power may require that the regime takes chances and stretches beyond its abilities at times, but 
in the spirit of juche and songun, the regime will continue this façade, fearful of losing the image 
its leaders have worked so hard to maintain.  
 
 
HP Security Research recommendations 

North Korean cyber operations are not generally observed originating from home field IP address 
space, so geo-IP based blocking of traffic originating from those net-blocks is ineffective.

Given that North Korea has capable and technically trained forces and will demonstrate their 
power when they feel provoked, western entities should consciously avoid promoting ideas or 
doctrine that is blatantly slanderous to the regime.  Encouraging such ideas could cause those 
entities to become a focal point for North Korean cyber attacks.  
 
Due to the fact that North Korean infrastructure is aging and its resources are not able to keep up 
with the rest of the world, entities with interesting R&D or IP (intellectual property) - especially 
military in nature – could become targets of interest for North Korea. Interest in defense-related 
IP and R&D could also stem from North Korea’s relationship with China.  In the Chinese business 
culture, taking another entity’s IP or R&D is not stealing – it is accepted as business as usual.  It is 
possible that North Korea, if under Chinese influence, would adopt the same attitude, given the 
regime’s limited capacity for homegrown innovation. 
 
Known DPRK targets have been limited primarily to South Korean and U.S. organizations and 
government entities. For these targets, prudent measures should include: 
 

  Following traditional defense in depth approaches and security best practices 
  Monitoring for malware that disables Korean language antivirus software, such as 

that from AhnLab 

  To protect against the attack vectors used in North Korean malware campaigns, 

an advisable prevention tactic is to focus on hardening update/patch 
management systems. These systems are appealing targets due to the potential 
for a large impact

Appendix C – Analysis of DarkSeoul Dropper 

Dropper 
 
MD5: 9263e40d9823aecf9388b64de34eae54  
Also known as/detected as :  

  Dropper-FDH (McAfee)  
  Trojan:Win32/Dembr.A (Microsoft)  
  Trojan.Jokra (Symantec) 

 
The dropper component that we examined was distributed as a UPX-packed binary. 
 
Installation 
 
When executed it creates the following files in the affected user’s %Temp% directory: 
 

•  alg.exe: A legitimate binary used to open SSH connections with remote servers  
  MD5 e45cd9052dd3dd502685dfd9aa2575ca  
 
• 

Size: 166,912 bytes  
conime.exe: A legitimate binary used to open SSH connections with remote servers  
MD5: 6a702342e8d9911bde134129542a045b  
Size: 153,600 bytes  

•  ~pr1.tmp: Payload - A destructive bash script  

MD5: dc789dee20087c5e1552804492b042cd  
Size: 1,186 bytes  
Also known as/detected as:   

KillMBR-FBIA (McAfee)  
Trojan:SH/Kofornix.A (Microsoft)  
Trojan.Jokra (Symantec)  

•  AgentBase.exe: Payload - Win32 wiper component (see details below)  
  MD5: db4bbdc36a78a8807ad9b15a562515c4  
 
 

Size: 24,576   
 

Payload—attempts to connect to remote servers and upload a destructive bash script   
 
After determining the location of user profile directories on the affected computer, the malware 
searches these directories for configuration files and directories that may be associated with the 
connection manager clients mRemote and SecureCRT.   
• mRemote—an open source tool for centrally managing remote server connections using a GUI 
(Kevin Kline, 2008).69 This tool is no longer being actively developed or supported.   
• SecureCRT—a commercial SSH and Telnet client by VanDyke Software.   
 
If an mRemote installation is located, the dropper reads the configuration file and checks if there’s 
a NODE that is defined with “Username=root”, “Protocol=SSH”, and a password that is not blank. If 

those conditions are satisfied it extracts the information. The password is decrypted after being 
extracted.   
 
If a SecureCRT installation is located, the dropper extracts information from sessions that have 
Username=root, Protocol=SSH and a saved password. If these conditions are satisfied, the 
username, hostname, port, and password are extracted. The password is then decrypted.   
 
After extracting these connection and server details, the dropper uses the previously dropped alg. 
exe and conime.exe to attempt to connect remote servers, upload and run the bash script 
~pr1.tmp.   
 
The bash script initially checks which UNIX it is running on (of HP-UX, SunOS, Linux, or AIX) and 
then attempts to wipe the /kernel, /usr /etc and /home directories, thus rendering the machine 
inoperative.  
 
Win32 Wiper component 
 
When the AgentBase.exe component is executed, it first attempts to stop the following processes, 
presumably in order to evade detection: 
 
• pasvc.exe – policy agent from AhnLab  
• clisvc.exe – ViRobot ISMS from Hauri 
 
It then enumerates all physical drives and overwrites the first 512 bytes with the string: 
“princpes”, effectively destroying the MBR (master boot record) of the affected drive. 
 
It continues to look for removable and fixed drives, locates the root directory on these drives, and 
then attempts to delete all files and folders in this directory. 
 
Finally, the affected computer is shut down and rebooted, although if the wiping mechanisms 
were successful then the machine will not be able to boot.
