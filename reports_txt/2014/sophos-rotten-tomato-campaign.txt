The Rotten Tomato Campaign

Overview
Malware authors are not shy about borrowing ideas. One of the most typical cases is the 
Tomato Garden case,1 where several different groups used the same zero-day Microsoft Word 
exploit. The term “used” means that they somehow get hold of a document that exploited the 
vulnerability, and then left the exploiting document part and the shellcode intact, only changed 
the appended encrypted executable at the end, and immediately they had what needed.

Something very similar happened just recently, in August and September of 2014. 

I always wanted to know how the malware writing groups worked. I mean the really serious ones, 
the ones behind Chinese state-sponsored APT attacks, or the groups behind high profile common 
malware, like Zeus.

This case offers another piece of insight. There must have been a staff meeting, where the 
manager prompted that, in the next malware distribution campaign they should not only use 
the aging CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, but the newer CVE-2014-1761 as well. The rest of the 
document will detail how some of the groups coped with this task.

Clearly, the malware authors took a sample somehow and started the implementation process. 
I wasn’t there, of course, so what follows is an educated guess based on the samples.

Template 1: CVE-2012-0158 + CVE-2014-1761 Combo
Recently we saw a lot of samples that exploit both CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761, and 
usually either download or drop a Zbot variant.

The document starts with the RTF header stuff, followed by the encrypted second stage. 

This is followed by the embedded object exploiting the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability with the 
shellcode. Following it is a block exploiting the CVE-2014-1761 with a shellcode of its own, 
as illustrated in the image below.

The color scheme I will use in the rest of the document is the following: green represents 
the properly used components; yellow the unused components; and red the incorrectly 
used components. 

Encrypted Zbot

CVE-2012-0158 exploit and Zbot shellcode

CVE-2014-1761 exploit and Zbot shellcode

Regardless of the particular exploit used, both shellcodes performed the memory egg-hunting 
for the memory markers of the second stage (as described in2), and decrypted it when found. 
The second stage could be either a downloader shellcode or a Win32 executable.

One of these samples was SHA1: c3a7cb43ec13299b758cb8ca25eace71329939f7, which 
contained an encrypted Zbot variant3 at the beginning of the RTF. It looks very likely that this 
sample was used as a development template for the other malware writing groups.

The Rotten Tomato Campaign

First attempt: Plugx
The first attempt must have come from the group deploying Plugx. They took the above 
mentioned sample, and made some modifications to it. 

The result looks like this one:

Encrypted Zbot

CVE-2012-0158 exploit and Plugx shellcode

CVE-2014-1761 exploit and Zbot shellcode

Encrypted Plugx

I can only guess that they didn’t understand the CVE-2014-1761 component, and thought that 
there was only one shellcode, in the CVE-2012-0158 segment. So they appended the encrypted 
Plugx executable, and replaced the first shellcode with their own. This shellcode contains the 
hardcoded offset of the embedded executable, and decrypts from there.

However, they left intact the encrypted Zbot executable at the beginning of the file and 
the second vulnerability, making this sample a real dual weapon: not only that it exploits 
two vulnerabilities, but contains two totally different payloads. However, Word can only be 
exploited once: during the exploitation procedure the current instance of Word exits, and a new 
one is started that displays the decoy document. So this creates a race condition: whichever 
vulnerability is triggered first (or gets lucky in an environment where the other one is patched) 
will have the chance to run its own payload.

Template 2: Goldsun
At some point they must have realized that it was wrong and tried to fix the CVE-2014-1761 part. 
For that, they took another recent sample, something similar to those that drop Goldsun Trojans 
(like this SHA1: e2474cc0da5a79af876771217eb81974e73c39e5)

In this case, the RTF only contains the CVE-2014-1761 vulnerability, with an appended 
executable. The vulnerability expects the second stage shellcode at a fixed file offset, checks a 
marker string there (“p!11”), and jumps to the second stage, which then decrypts and executes 
the final Win32 payload.

The Rotten Tomato Campaign

CVE-2014-1761 exploit and Goldsun shellcode

Memory marker and Goldsun second stage shellcode

Start marker and encrypted Goldsun

Second attempts
A large group of samples were created by a sort of a fusion of the Zbot and the Goldsun 
samples, resulting in a structure like this one:

Encrypted Zbot

CVE-2012-0158 exploit and Plugx shellcode

CVE-2014-1761 exploit and Goldsun shellcode

Memory marker and Goldsun second stage shellcode

Encrypted Plugx

Blank

So now there are two different shellcodes. The first, from Plugx, reads the length of the 
embedded decoy document and Win32 payload from the end of the file, and using this info 
locates and decrypts the appended payload. This shellcode identifies the host document by 
checking if the last dword is the same as the dword before that rotated by 3. And the same 
holds for another two dwords before that. These dwords also store the length of the appended 
PE payload and decoy document lengths. This structure makes it possible to swap the payload 
without changing the exploit and shellcode part.

The shellcode from Goldsun executes the second stage code from a fixed offset.

The Rotten Tomato Campaign

There are a couple of problems with this implementation. First, the defunctional encrypted 
Zbot remains in these files, with no purpose at all. But the real problem is with the Goldsun 
style CVE-2014-1761 block. It was snatched from the CVE-2014-1761 exploiting document, 
and pasted after the existing Zbot+CVE-2012-0158 combo. Clearly, the offset where the 
second stage code would be shifted with the different prepended content, but it never 
happened. As a result, the CVE-2014-1761 exploitation doesn’t work, despite all the efforts 
of the malware authors.

A couple of distinct malware groups were identified that use these schematics.

Plugx
All of these samples are Plugx v2 samples.4 Most of the time they use Russian related themes in 
the decoy document.

Appat
These are new Trojans. Not connected to Plugx at code level, but the overlap between the C&C 
servers, the same domain registration contact (yuminga1@126.com), and the similar Russian 
theme indicates that the same group deployed them.

The dumped payload shows similar functionality to what Plugx (or any other general purpose

Successful integrations
But not all were failures. There were two samples that followed the above structure, and the 
Goldsun shellcode offset was fixed.

However, both samples were only dropping and executing a Chinese nationalized version of calc.
exe – these are clearly test samples from China.

Furthermore, a couple of common malware samples were found with fixed second stage offsets, 
showing that at least these guys know what they are doing. Still, they kept the inactive encrypted 
Zbot at the beginning of the document.

Detour: Plugx
During the analysis of this campaign we ran into a handful of samples that have nothing to do with 
CVE-2014-1761, but they contained some of the encrypted Zbot at the beginning of the file. The end 
of encrypted PE is truncated, and the CVE-2012-0158 code is replaced with the Plugx shellcode. 

Interestingly, there is another shellcode, which is starts with the same marker (“p!11”) as the 
Goldsun second stage code, but the execution logic is the same as the Plugx shellcode. However, 
this shellcode just hangs in the air, no execution path leads to it. It is not clear, where these 
samples fit in the development path, could be that after the failure to integrate CVE-2014-1761, 
the corresponding part was simply ditched from the samples.

Conclusion
Apart from the lesson learned about malware development, what can we learn from this process?

The partially successful Plugx attempt raises a few questions. Should it be considered as a 
common cybercrime sample (as the dropped Zbot suggests) or as an APT (as Plugx does)? 
Actually, it depends on the patch level of the targeted computer.

The narrow line between APT and common malware shrank to zero with that sample. We have seen 
earlier6 that authors of common malware are getting the idea of document-based exploitation 
from the APT players. Now it is swinging back – targeted attack players are snatching ideas from 
the other group. The fact that the attempt was less successful does not deny the fact that a 
symbiosis exists between the two distinct criminal groups, and ideas are floating in both directions.
