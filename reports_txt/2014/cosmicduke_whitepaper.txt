In this document we report on our analysis of 
CosmicDuke - the first malware seen to include 
code from both the notorious MiniDuke APT trojan 
and another longstanding threat, the information-
stealing Cosmu family. When active on an infected 
machine, CosmicDuke will search for and harvest 
login details from a range of programs and forward 
the data to remote servers, some of which were 
active at the time of writing.

INTRODUCTION
In early 2013, the MiniDuke malware was discovered in 
use in a series of attacks against NATO and European 
government agencies. While investigating MiniDuke 
loaders in April 2014, we were surprised to notice that the 
malicious executable being decompressed and loaded 
into memory was very similar to the Cosmu family of 
information-stealers, which we saw as long ago as 2001. 
Cosmu is the first malware family we have seen to share 
code with MiniDuke.  

This analysis is focused on those Cosmu samples that 
share code with MiniDuke. Some of these are older than 
the oldest publicly documented MiniDuke samples, 
implying that the shared code might have been originally 
used by Cosmu, not MiniDuke. For convenience, we 
decided to name the samples showing this amalgamation 
of MiniDuke-derived loader and Cosmu-derived payload 
CosmicDuke.

The filenames and content used in CosmicDuke’s 
attack files to lure victims into opening them contain 
references to the countries of Ukraine, Poland, Turkey 
and Russia,either generally in use of language or included 
detail, or in allusions to events or institutions. The 
filenames and content chosen seem to be tailored to their 
target’s interests, though at the time of writing, we have 
no further information on the identity or location of these 
victims.  

CosmicDuke infections start by tricking victims into 
opening either a PDF file that contains an exploit or a 
Windows executable whose filename is manipulated to 
make it look like a document or image file. 

Once the victim opens the file, the malware gains 
persistence on the system and starts collecting 
information. The data collection components include a 
keylogger, clipboard stealer, screenshotter, and password 
stealers for a variety of popular chat, email and web 

browsing programs. It also collects information about 
the files on the system, and has the capability to export 
cryptographic certificates and the associated private keys. 

Once the information has been collected, it is sent out to 
remote servers via FTP. In addition to stealing information 
from the system, Cosmu allows the attacker to download 
and execute other malware on the system.

F-Secure has detections for all the different malicious 
components used by the Cosmu variants described in this 
report. 

SCOPE
We have seen dozens of Cosmu samples that share code 
with MiniDuke. Rather than cover the entire spectrum 
of samples, the scope of this analysis was intentionally 
limited to highlighting the most interesting of the 
recent samples. This includes examining the attack files 
used to infect targets, the remote servers storing data 
collected from the victims and the differences between 
the MiniDuke loaders and Cosmu info-stealers used in the 
samples.

TARGET
This analysis is based on examination of files we gathered 
through our sample collection systems. Based on the 
nature of the filenames and decoy documents used, and 
the fact that the MiniDuke loader is known to be used as a 
part of targeted attacks, we suspect that CosmicDuke may 
also be used in such operations. At the time of writing, 
we have not identified any victims ourselves, nor are we 
aware of any public reports confirming this scenario. 

3

DATA THEFT  
CosmicDuke’s primary purpose is to steal information. The 
different ways it collects information from the infected 
machine are as follows:

 y Keylogger
 y Taking screenshots
 y Stealing data from clipboard
 y Stealing files
 y Stealing PKI certificates and associated private keys
 y Stealing usernames and passwords from browsers, 

instant messengers and email clients

 y Stealing WLAN passwords
 y Stealing Windows password hashes

DATA TRANSMISSION
The information collected by the malware is automatically 
uploaded to remote servers via FTP. Our analysis also 
reveals various details of the remote sites contacted by 
CosmicDuke, including the login credentials used and the 
FTP folder structure. 

At the time of writing, most of these remote sites are live. 
A list of the servers CosmicDuke malware connects to is 
on page 15.

ARRIVAL
At this time, we have no information on how the 
CosmicDuke attack files are delivered to the victims, 
though based on the findings from the analysis, we can 
make an educated guess.

It is possible that the PDF documents containing exploits 
were emailed to the targeted users as file attachments. 
Assuming that the email gateway used by the victims does 
not include an antivirus solution capable of identifying the 
exploit, such files would have little impediment to being 
spread by email.

It is however unlikely that the samples which camouflaged 
the executable files as image or document files would 
be distributed in the same way. Regardless of any tricks 
played with the filenames, the files themselves are 
Windows executables, and many email solutions today 
prevent users from opening attached executable files. 

INFECTION
The attackers are using at least two different methods for 
infecting the systems: exploits and social engineering.

DOCUMENT-BASED EXPLOIT
CosmicDuke malware samples that use exploits to gain 
entry onto a target system (referred to as exploit files 
in the rest of this document) start with a malicious 
Flash object embedded into a PDF file. When the file is 
launched, the object exploits the known CVE-2011-0611 
vulnerability in specific versions of Adobe Flash, Reader 
and Acrobat products.

Unlike the CosmicDuke files geared towards social 
engineering, the exploit files do not actually display 
any documents to the user as a form of distraction; the 
malware simply straightaway exploits the vulnerability.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING
Less technically challenging CosmicDuke samples use 
simple social engineering to trick the user into willingly 
launching the attack file. Once launched, the file drops 
the malware onto the system (such files are therefore 
referred to as droppers in the rest of this documents).

To do so, the malware’s executable file is first disguised as 
an image or document to make it seem innocuous. When 
launched, a document or image is displayed in order to 
draw the user’s attention away from any background 
activity. In the meantime, the malware’s malicious files are 
silently installed and executed on the system.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
CosmicDuke samples can be divided into 3 distinct groups 
based on similarities between the C&C servers they 
contact, file characteristics and decoy document used. 
The full details of how the samples were grouped is listed 
on page 11; Figure 2 at left provides a quick summary of the 
grouping as they relate to how CosmicDuke is delivered, 
and the decoy documents shown.

The first group of samples (Group #1) is spread using 3 
dropper files that display specific decoy documents. The 
second sample group (Group #2) uses both exploit-loaded 
files and dropper files. The third group (Group #3) is rather 
an exception, as it does not use the droppers or exploits 
listed here; for the sake of simplicity, we will exclude 
considering Group #3’s delivery method.

Image 1: Screenshot of folder containing CosmicDuke dropper files

DROPPER: RLO
CosmicDuke’s author(s) disguised the fact that the 
malware is an executable file by using the Right-to-Left 
Override (RLO) feature in Windows to hide the file’s 
correct file extension, .exe or .scr, and replace it with .jpg, 
.pdf or .doc, in order to make the file appear to be an 
innocuous document or image.  

Image 1 is a screenshot of how the filenames look like in 
Windows 7. The real file extension for the top four files is 
.scr, while the real extension for the bottom one is .exe. 

Note that the attacker has also carefully changed the icon 
of the executable to reflect the fake filetype for the first 
four. 

The bottom file is a curious exception, as it does not use a 
PDF icon as would be expected with a .pdf file extension; 
instead, it uses an NVIDIA icon, most likely to reflect the 
fact that the product name of the executable is listed 
as “NVIDIA Update Components” in the file’s version 
information. This seems to be a common fake product 
name used in the latest Cosmu samples. Meanwhile, the 

filename readily visible to the users is translated from 
Turkish as “civilian crisis center status report”.  

The use of RLO is a smart move from the attackers. Why 
go through the trouble of exploiting anything if you can 
simply trick the user into double-clicking an executable 
that looks a lot like a document file? 

As the screenshot demonstrates, unchecking “Hide 
extensions for known filetypes” does not help. The three-
letter file extensions seen at the end of the filename is not 
the real file extension. Even though the information in the 
Type column is correct, most of the users probably do not 
even check it.

DROPPER: DECOYS
CosmicDuke dropper files all display some kind of a decoy 
document or image to distract the user when the attack 
file is launched. 

The following are the droppers used by Group #1. Here are 
the filenames of the decoys, as displayed in Windows, and 
the decoy images or files they show when launched:

 y rcs.18.jpg  
 
 
 y rcs.DSC_1365527283.jpg 

- Image 2
- Image 3
- Image 4 

The decoys are interesting. Заказ means “order” in 
Russian. Based on the characters СЖС-1295 and ГХРП 
found in the decoy, the document looks like an order for 
growth hormones. The document contains full delivery 
address, including the name of the person placing the 
order.

An interesting detail about the image file of a receipt 
(Image 3) shown by rcs.18.jpg is that it contains EXIF 
metadata, including the date when the photo was taken 
and the model of the mobile phone that was used to take 
the photo. Part of this EXIF metadata is shown in Image 3a. 

The third dropper file we’ve seen uses the filename ‘rcs.
Ukraine-Gas-Pipelines-Security-Report-March-2014.pdf’, 
and displays the decoy document shown in Image 6. This 
particular dropper file is notable in that its info-stealer 
(SHA1:f513b21738ae3083d79e4fa1039889e1c3efff58) is the 
same one used by the exploit file named “Bulletin-PISM-
No-31-(625)-March-10-2014.pdf”.

EXPLOIT
The code used by CosmicDuke to exploit the CVE-2011-
0611 vulnerability appears to be derived from this proof-
of-concept code that was made available in early 2011:

 y http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17473/
 
The samples we analyzed of the exploit-based 
CosmicDuke variety had the file names and SHA1 values 
listed in Figure 3 at right (see “Appendix A | Samples” for 
more details).

Some of these exploit files have interesting filenames, 
such as “dip.mail march.pdf” and “Bulletin-PISM-No-
31-(625)-March-10-2014.pdf”. The PISM mentioned in 
the latter presumably refers to the Polish Institute of 
International Affairs [1]. 

LOADER: MINIDUKE 3RD STAGE
The CosmicDuke samples we analyzed used the same 
loader as MiniDuke’s stage 3 [2] samples, making this the 
first occasion in which we’ve seen other malware using 
this particular loader.

The parallel usage of the loader in the CosmicDuke and 
MiniDuke families is interesting. The oldest samples we 
have of this loader that loads Cosmu malware show the 
compilation date of the loader as March 24 2011, which 
predates the oldest publicly documented MiniDuke 
sample (with a recorded loader compilation date of 
June 18 2012). The earlier use of the loader with a Cosmu 
payload leads us to suspect the existence of a link 
between the author(s) of Cosmu and MiniDuke.  

The most common compilation date seen for the loaders 
that load the Cosmu malware is November 13 2012. 
Perhaps coincidentally, we found one MiniDuke sample 
(originally reported by CrySys [3]) that also shows the same 
compilation date. In this case however, the MiniDuke 
component is actually a downloader; it connects to an 
IP address in Turkey, and when it receives a response, 
decrypts and executes it.

Also of interest is that once the MiniDuke loader was 
updated, we saw CosmicDuke samples take the updated 
loader into use in mid-April 1 2014, a few months after 
MiniDuke started using the latest loader in mid-December 
2013. It seems possible that the actors behind the two 
malware families share code and/or tools.

MAIN COMPONENT: INFO-STEALER
The Cosmu info-stealer is the main component of the 
CosmicDuke malware. The technical description of the 
info-stealer is based on analysis of the following sample: 
 
SHA1: b072577447cdf3936d95e612057e510dd3435963. 

PERSISTENCE
Cosmu has a couple of different mechanisms for achieving 
persistence on the system. It creates a scheduled task and 
installs a Windows service.

The scheduled task is typically named “Watchmon 
Service”. It executes the malware at system startup.

The service typically has name javamtsup, and the display 
name is ”Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service”. The 
size of the service binary on disk varies, but typically the 
real size is 5120 bytes (based on PE headers) and the SHA1 
value is 7803f160af428bcfb4b9ea2aba07886f232cde4e. 

The service itself is very straightforward: it opens a handle 
to explorer.exe process, duplicates its process token, 
reads the path of the actual malware binary from registry 
(key HKLM\Software\JavaSoft, value Supplement) and 
starts the malware using the duplicated process token.

Cosmu copies itself with a couple of different filenames 
to %WINDIR%\system32. The binaries on the disk have a 
variable length of zero-padding but they are all essentially 
copies of the original malware binary. 

The filenames for both the Cosmu copies and the service 
binary are generated by randomly taking two items from 
the following list and concatenating them, resulting in 
filenames like usbmon.exe, urllsa.exe, and rasdns.exe:

 y env
 y lib
 y udf
 y wm 
 y win
 y id 
 y wdm
 y mgr

 PASSWORD STEALING

The malware targets the following software:

 y Instant messaging

  Skype 

The malware steals Skype login MD5. The attacker 
can obtain victim’s Skype username and password 
by using a bruteforce or dictionary attack to crack 
the MD5. The attack was publicly documented in 
2006  [4]. 

  Google Talk 

Cosmu decrypts and steals saved credentials from 
Google Talk.

  MSN Messenger 

Cosmu decrypts and steals saved credentials from 
MSN Messenger.

 y Browsers

  Google Chrome 

Cosmu steals saved credentials from Google 
Chrome.

  Internet Explorer 

Cosmu steals autocomplete passwords from IE. It 
also collects information about visited websites, 
i.e., browsing history.

  Firefox 

Cosmu steals saved credentials and the associated 
URLs from Firefox. The malware does not decrypt 
the credentials.

 y Email clients

  Thunderbird 

Cosmu steals saved credentials and the associated 
mail server hostnames from Thunderbird. The 
malware does not decrypt the credentials.

  Bat email client 

Cosmu steals credentials from Bat email client 
by parsing account.cfn and decrypting the 
credentials.

  Outlook Express 

Cosmu steals saved credentials and information 
about the associated mail server from Outlook 
Express.
  Outlook 

Cosmu steals saved credentials and information 
about the associated mail server from Outlook.

  Google Desktop 

Cosmu decrypts and steals saved credentials from 
Google Desktop.

       http://www.recon.cx/en/f/vskype-part2.pdf

8

 y Others

  Windows credentials  

LM and NT hashes, cached domain passwords, LSA 
secrets.
  WLAN 

Cosmu uses WlanGetProfile to retrieve plain text 
keys for WLANs.

 
CERTIFICATE STEALING

Cosmu exports certificates and, if available, the 
associated private keys from system store by calling 
PFXExportCertStoreEx. The malware uses the password 
“saribas” to encrypt the exported data.

TARGETED FILETYPES
Cosmu searches the hard drives and network drives for 
files that match any of the below patterns:

 y *.doc
 y *.xps
 y *.xls
 y *.ppt
 y *.pps
 y *.wps
 y *.wpd
 y *.ods
 y *.odt
 y *.lwp
 y *.jtd

 y *.pdf
 y *.zip
 y *.rar
 y *.docx
 y *.url
 y *.xlsx
 y *.pptx
 y *.ppsx
 y *.pst
 y *.ost
 y *psw*

 y *pass*
 y *login*
 y *admin*
 y *sifr*
 y *sifer*
 y *vpn
 y *.jpg
 y *.txt
 y *.lnk

Patterns *sifr* and *sifer* are interesting because they 
clearly target non-English filenames, given that ‘sifr’ is the 
Arabic word for zero (and interestingly enough, also the 
base word for an encryption cipher in many languages).

KEY LOGGER
The keylogger is implemented using the 
GetKeyboardState API. Key logging is skipped if one of the 
following AV process is running on the system:

 y avp.exe
 y acs.exe
 y outpost.exe
 y mcvsescn.exe
 y mcods.exe
 y navapsvc.exe
 y kav.exe
 y AvastSvc.exe
 y AvastUi.exe
 y nod32krn.exe
 y nod32.exe
 y ekern.exe
 y dwengine.exe
 y MsMpEng.exe
 y msseces.exe
 y ekrn.exe
 y savservice.exe
 y scfservice.exe
 y savadminservice.exe 

SCREENSHOTTER
Cosmu takes screenshots periodically and sends them to 
the attacker, together with other stolen data. 

CLIPBOARD STEALER
Cosmu copies the content of the clipboard every 30 
seconds and sends those to the attacker together with 
other stolen data.

Cosmu searches removable drives for a broader set of files 
– only files whose filename matches any of the following 
patterns are skipped/ignored:

CONFIGURATION
The configuration can contain the following information:

 y *.exe
 y *.ndb
 y *.mp3
 y *.avi 

An interesting detail is that Cosmu skips searching the 
removable drive if the volume name is “trandescend” 
(case insensitive comparison).  

 y HTTP server IPs and URL paths
 y FTP server IPs, usernames and passwords
 y WebDav IPs, usernames and passwords
 y Filename prefix and file extension for downloaded files
 y Filename prefix and file extension for exfiltrated data 

In all the configurations we have seen, the servers are 
specified using IP addresses, not domain names.

The configuration is embedded into the info-stealer. It is 
compressed using an algorithm similar to but simpler than 
LZNT-1 [5]. 

5. Microsoft Developer Network; 2.5 LZNT1 Algorithm Details; 
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj665697.aspx

 NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS

The sample makes HTTP GET requests to the server(s) 
specified in the configuration. The GET request contains 
the following fields in this order: 

 y m or mgn
 y Auth
 y Session
 y DataID
 y FamilyID
 y BranchID
 y VolumeID
 y User
 y Query.
 
The first field, m or mgn, does not have any value.

The value of Auth is the ID of the sample. It is the same 
8-character hex digit that can be found in the PDB path, 
among other places.

The value of Query depends on the request. It is either 
encoded using URL safe base64, or then the value is 
a 1792-character string. That string is composed of a 
256-character string that is repeated seven times. 

The 256-character string is generated by selecting 
characters randomly from the following 32-character 
alphabet:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345

The malware uses the FTP servers and WebDav servers 
both for exfiltrating the collected data and for updating 
the malware.

All servers used by the info-stealers listed in “Appendix A | 
Samples” are listed in “Appendix B | Servers”.

RC4 ENCRYPTION
Cosmu uses RC4 to decrypt incoming data and encrypt 
outgoing data. The RC4 routine is not standard RC4, but 
instead of an intentional customization it seems that the 
implementation is simply buggy. The mistake is illustrated 
in Figure 5 that shows a Python re-implementation of the 
buggy RC4.

All RC4 keys are 32 bytes. Here are the known keys:

 y pHG5AS4deKLil9ADdR2BcA1hTNm0FQz3
 y 3Pf4GxTaDnx50qWe2Xz62uSptFsR3g3P
 y AdjustKernelTableFromSSDTSpace2\x00
 y FB7V61C7509E4L99BDZ7F74A79A69CDF
 
Even though only the first 32 bytes are used as the RC4 
key, the first two RC4 keys in the above list are followed by

“A true friend is someone who thinks that you are a good 
egg even though he knows that you are slightly cracked” 
is a Bernard Meltzer quote. 

SAMPLES COMPARISON
A comparison of the compilation times of the 
samples, and of other similarities observed in the file 
characteristics, reveals some interesting patterns. For 
more details, see “Appendix A | Samples”.

LEGACY CREDENTIALS AND FTP FOLDER STRUCTURE
The oldest Cosmu samples we saw have a compilation 
timestamp of 2001-09-25. Since it is possible for the 
compilation timestamp to be manipulated, it may be that 
the samples are not that old. We have however not seen 
any samples that would give us reason to suspect that the 
timestamp has been tampered with. 

These old samples do not use the MiniDuke loader and 
therefore are not discussed in detail in this analysis. They 
do however show some characteristics that link them 
to these fresh variants. For example, the credentials and 
same FTP folder structure used by the old samples have 
been used on another Cosmu FTP server that is still active.

COMPILATION TIMELINE
All droppers were compiled on 2013-08-02.  The 
majority of the loaders were compiled on 2012-11-
13, though one was compiled on 2012-12-04 - oddly 
enough, the same day when one MiniDuke payload 
reported by BitDefender [6] and Kaspersky [7], (md5: 
6bc34809e44c40b61dd29e0a387ee682) was compiled. 
This was a downloader that connects to an IP address in 
Turkey. As the server is no longer up however, we were 
unable to investigate it further.

The compilation timestamps of the info-stealers show 
more variation. The oldest variant loaded with the 
MiniDuke loader was compiled on 2012-12-04. Most of the 
info-stealers were compiled in February and March 2014.

INFO-STEALER GROUPING
The info-stealer samples we have analyzed can be also 
be separated into three distinct groupings based on the 
following attributes:

 y The program database (PDB) path
 y Server address and credentials
 y The loader
 y Filenames and decoy content
 
Full list of the servers contacted by samples in these 
groupings in available in Appendix B | Servers on page 15.

Group #1

All samples in this group have a PDB path on the 
infected system’s C:\ drive that contains the directory 
“botgenstudio”.

      http://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/04/MiniDuke_Paper_Final.pdf
7. Securelist; C. Raiu, I. Soumenkov, K. Baumgartner & V. Kamluk; The MiniDuke Mystery: PDF 0-day Government Spy Assembler 0x29A  
    Micro  Backdoor;  https://www.securelist.com/en/downloads/vlpdfs/themysteryofthepdf0-dayassemblermicrobackdoor.pdf

Group #3

The most recent CosmicDuke samples all belong to this 
group. Unlike Groups #1 and #2, no exploits or droppers 
are known to be associated with Group #3 samples, and 
the loader filenames do not use the RLO trick. As such, we  
will not cover Group #3’s delivery method further.

Of more interest with Group #3 is that older samples 
within this groupin show some differences from the 
latest variants. A few older samples in Group #3 still use 
the original MiniDuke loader, while most recent ones are 
using the updated MiniDuke loader. 

Another difference is that unlike the older ones, the latest 
samples use the following PDB path: 

 y D:\PRODUCTION\NITRO\KSK\Generations\70BCDEA1\

bin\Bot.pdb.  

This is quite similar to Group #2, though it seems “SVA” has 
been replaced by “KSK”.

All samples in Group #3 connect to an FTP server at IP 
188.116.32.164 using the same username (“adair”) and 
password. This is the only server that the samples with the 
original MiniDuke loader use.

Meanwhile, the most recent sample  in Group #3, 
which uses the updated loader with t the SHA1 value 
fecdba1d903a51499a3953b4df1d850fbd5438bd, also 
connects to another server at IP address 178.21.172.157. 
The updated loader has PDB path, C:\Projects\NEMESIS\
nemesis-gemina\nemesis\bin\carriers\ezlzma_x86_exe.
pdb.

12

 y c:\botgenstudio\generations\8f1777b0\bin\Bot.pdb
 y c:\botgenstudio\generations\fed14e50\bin\Bot.pdb
 y c:\botgenstudio\generations\55ff7700\bin\Bot.pdb 

All samples in this group use the same RC4 key:

“FB7V61C7509E4L99BDZ7F74A79A69CDF”

The servers used by this group are exclusive to this group, 
i.e., the other sample groups do not use any of the servers 
group #1 uses. The IP address of the servers used by this 
group of samples are in Luxembourg, Netherlands, and 
Russia. See “Appendix B | Servers” for details. 

We have seen three different droppers for this sample 
group. All droppers use the RLO trick.

We have not found any exploits associated to this group of 
samples.

Group #2

All samples in this group have a PDB path that contains 
directories named “NITRO” and “SVA”. The PDB path is 
always on D:\ drive. Here are some examples:

 y D:\production\nitro\sva\generations\809113dd\bin\

Bot.pdb

 y D:\SVA\NITRO\PRODUCTION\Generations\805B1D01\

bin\bot.pdb

 y D:\PRODUCTION\NITRO\SVA\Generations\8052B6C0\

bin\Bot.pdb

 y D:\PRODUCTION\NITRO\SVA\Generations\80B8A0BA\

bin\bot.pdb

All samples except one in this group use PDF files with 
exploits as an infection vector. The sole exception is 
sha1:98f81b03a3b0f7b0b914d783683817953e8d4cf0. It 
does not use an exploit and it does not use a dropper;  
instead the loader has a filename (Sivil Durum Raporu Kriz 
Merk?fdp.izay.exe) that uses the same RLO trick used in 
Group #1 samples.

Another interesting detail for this sample is the PDB path:

 d:\sva\nitro\botgenstudio\interface\
generations\80ddfcc1\bin\Bot.pdb

Even though this contains both “SVA” and “NITRO”, it 
also contains “botgenstudio”, again making it similar 
to Group #1. One other sample in Group #2 (sha1: 
fb3b8f6494b211386381a7e4f6524d3e4643c9e9) shows a 
similar PDB path.

The servers used by this group are exclusive to this group, 
i.e., the other sample groups do not use any of the servers 
group #2 uses.
