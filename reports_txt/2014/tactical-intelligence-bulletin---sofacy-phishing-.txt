Background 

Our analysts follow the activities of a number of threat groups with a wide range of motivations. In this 
bulletin we are sharing intelligence relating to a recent phishing campaign conducted by a group widely 
referred to as ‘Sofacy’, named after the antivirus1 detection name for one of the malware families used by 
the group. 
 
Over the years there have been a number of papers discussing variations to the malware used by the 
group, but little discussion of less sophisticated techniques employed by the same attackers. 
 
Analysis 

Sofacy has been discussed before as being used to target APEC members2 and there has also been some 
prior analysis of the malware itself3. Variants of the malware have been in use for a considerable amount 
of time – for example, the screenshot below is from the decoy document loaded by one of the earliest 
versions present on ThreatExpert4, from February 2010. 
 

Sample 5e3bea788e89e0814e898b4a648b93c0b74f7e2c 

 

 
Decoy documents are used in conjunction with malware droppers in order to make the target believe the 
file they have just opened is legitimate. The documents often give an indication of the attackers’ intended 
targets. 
 
More recently, ESET have reported5 on related spear phishes using NATO/Ukrainian conflict themes and 
watering hole attacks likely targeting the defence industry and a Polish finance company. It has been 
publicly speculated before that Sofacy malware is Russian in origin. Indicators found in the malware 
analysis referenced in the appendix, such as embedded resources and targeting would appear to support 
this theory.

Targeting 
 
Recently, we observed a number of new domain registrations by the Sofacy attackers, all of which are 
closely related via shared WHOIS data and infrastructure. New domain registrations are usually 
indicative of a new campaign, and so we were eager to find new samples of the malware which connected 
to the infrastructure. The domain names chosen were almost identical to the legitimate domains of 
several organisations, a common technique and, like carefully chosen decoy documents, often gives clues 
as to the likely targets of the campaign. The new domain names mimicked organisations in the following 
categories: 
 

• 

International and European diplomatic institutions 

•  Popular providers of web services 

•  Military institutions, contractors and conferences 

•  Energy companies 

•  News organisations based out of the United States and Central Europe 

In addition to new malware samples, we also found examples where the attackers were using the simple 
technique  of  phishing  for  credentials.  The  usage  of  malware  in  targeted  attacks  to  steal  information  of 
value  to  attackers  has  been  widely  reported,  however  the  simple  technique  of  phishing  for  credentials, 
whilst still relatively common in targeted attacks, is still more typically associated with criminal attackers 
involved in day to day cyber-fraud. 

The pages used for phishing typically used obfuscated code to redirect the user to another webpage: 
 

 

 
In  some  pages  the  malicious  redirect  was  disabled  by  the  attackers,  by  placing  additional  JavaScript  on 
the page which would redirect users to a legitimate site preferentially. 
 
Fake login pages were observed both for webmail and two factor-authentication platforms. In the second 
case  this  would  require  the  attackers  to  log  in  at  the  same  time  as  affected  victims,  showing  a  level  of 
dedication to the cause. As well as the domains used being similar to those of the targeted, the pages were 
also made to appear the same as their legitimate counterparts, making it difficult for end-users to tell they 
were being duped. 
 
For example the screenshot below shows the contents of a credential phishing website designed to mimic 
the legitimate OWA site of a defence contractor. The attacker’s version is on the left, the real version is on 
the right:

Two  of  the  domains  we  identified  have  previously  been  associated  in  open  source  with  credential 
phishing, although not attributed to this group of attackers: 
 

 

 

 
 

In  October  2013  the  domain  chmail[.]in  was  reported 6 as  being  used  in  widespread  attacks 
against users of the Iranian mail service chmail[.]ir 

In January 2014 the domain google-settings[.]com was reported7 as being used in credential theft 
against some gmail users. 

 
Recommended Actions 

As  ever  with  phishing  attacks,  one  of  the  most  important  preventative  steps  you  can  take  is  to  educate 
staff on how to identify suspicious emails – especially as there are fewer technical measures that can be 
taken to prevent low distribution phishing attacks which aim to steal credentials than there are for similar 
attacks involving malware.  
 
Organisations  with  good  logging  for  their  e-mail  data  could  attempt  to  detect  activity  relating  to 
compromised accounts by alerting on “impossible journeys”, where locations from which users log in are 
monitored and where alerts are produced when a single user logs in from two separate countries in a short 
period of time. 
 
Snort Signatures 

We have developed some SNORT signatures to detect the current template used by the attackers in their 
phishing campaigns. The following signatures detect Javascript that is present on many obfuscated 
redirects, not necessarily related to this activity but which may be indicative of Sofacy phishing:
