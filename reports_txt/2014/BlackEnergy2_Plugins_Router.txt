BE2 Custom Plugins, Router Abuse, and Target Profiles

The BlackEnergy malware is crimeware turned APT tool and is used in significant geopolitical operations
lightly documented over the past year. An even more interesting part of the BlackEnergy story is the
relatively unknown custom plugin capabilities to attack ARM and MIPS platforms, scripts for Cisco
network devices, destructive plugins, a certificate stealer and more. Here, we present available data - it is
difficult to collect on this APT. We will also present more details on targets previously unavailable and
present related victim profile data.

These attackers are careful to hide and defend their long-term presence within compromised
environments. The malware's previously undescribed breadth means attackers present new technical
challenges in unusual environments, including SCADA networks. Challenges, like mitigating the attackers'
lateral movement across compromised network routers, may take an organization's defenders far beyond
their standard routine and out of their comfort zone.

Brief History

BlackEnergy2 and BlackEnergy3 are known tools. Initially, cybercriminals used BlackEnergy custom
plugins for launching DDoS attacks. There are no indications of how many groups possess this tool.
BlackEnergy2 was eventually seen downloading more crimeware plugins - a custom spam plugin and a
banking information stealer custom plugin. Over time, BlackEnergy2 was assumed into the toolset of the
BE2/Sandworm actor. While another crimeware group continues to use BlackEnergy to launch DDoS
attacks, the BE2 APT appears to have used this tool exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and
included custom plugins and scripts of their own. To be clear, our name for this actor has been the BE2
APT, while it has been called "Sandworm Team" also.

The Plugins and Config Files

Before evidence of BlackEnergy2 use in targeted attacks was uncovered, we tracked strange activity on one
of the BlackEnergy CnC servers in 2013. This strangeness was related to values listed in
newer BlackEnergy configuration files. As described in Dmitry's 2010 Black DDoS' analysis, a
configuration file is downloaded from the server by main.dll on an infected system. The config file
provides download instructions for the loader. It also instructs the loader to pass certain commands to the
plugins. In this particular case in 2013, the config file included an unknown plugin set, aside from the
usual 'ddos' plugin listing. Displayed below are these new, xml formatted plugin names "weap_hwi", "ps",
and "vsnet" in a BlackEnergy configuration file download from a c2 server. This new module push must
have been among the first for this group, because all of the module versions were listed as "version 1",
including the ddos plugin:

Config downloaded from BE2 server

The 'ps' plugin turned out to be password stealer. The 'vsnet' plugin was intended to spread and launch a
payload (BlackEnergy2 dropper itself at the moment) in the local network by using PsExec, as well as
gaining primary information on the user's computer and network. Most surprising was the 'weap_hwi'
plugin. It was a ddos tool compiled to run on ARM systems:

Weap_hwi plugin

At first, we didn't know whether the ARM plugin was listed intentionally or by mistake, so we proceeded to
collect the CnC's config files. After pulling multiple config files, we confirmed that this ARM object
inclusion was not a one-off mistake. The server definitely delivered config files not only for Windows, but
also for the ARM/MIPS platform. Though unusual, the ARM module was delivered by the same server and
it processed the same config file.

Linux plugins

Over time we were able to collect several plugins as well as the main module for ARM and MIPS
architectures. All of these ARM/MIPS object files were compiled from the same source and later pushed
out in one config: "weap_msl", "weap_mps", "nm_hwi", "nm_mps", "weap_hwi", and "nm_msl". It's
interesting that the BE2 developers upgraded the ddos plugin to version 2, along with the nm_hwi,
nm_mps, and nm_msl plugins. They simultaneously released version 5 of the weap_msl, weap_mps, and
weap_hmi plugins. Those assignments were not likely arbitrary, as this group had developed
BlackEnergy2 for several years in a professional and organized style:

Here is the list of retrieved files and related functionality:

Weap, Snif, Nm plugin grammar mistakes and mis-spellings

The developers' coding style differed across the 'Hook' main module, the plugins, and the Windows
main.dll. The hook main module contained encrypted strings and handled all the function calls and
strings as the references in a large structure. This structure obfuscation may be a rewrite effort to better
modularize the code, but could also be intended to complicate analysis. Regardless, it is likely that
different individuals coded the different plugins. So, the BE2 effort must have its own small team of plugin
and multiplatform developers.

Hook module structure

After decrypting the strings, it became clear that the Linux Hook main module communicated with the
same CnC server as other Windows modules:

The CNC's IP address in the Linux module

This Linux module can process the following commands, some of which are similar to the Windows
version:

die
kill
lexec
rexec
update
migrate

delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces
delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces and reboot
launch a command using bin/sh
download and launch file using 'fork/exec'
rewrite self file
update the CnC server

Windows Plugins

After the disclosure of an unusual CnC server that pushed Linux and the new Windows plugins we paid
greater attention to new BE2 samples and associated CnCs.

During an extended period, we were able to collect many Windows plugins from different CnC servers,
without ever noticing Linux plugins being downloaded as described above. It appears the BE2/SandWorm
gang protected their servers by keeping their non-Windows hacker tools and plugins in separate servers or
server folders. Finally, each CnC server hosts a different set of plugins, meaning that each server works
with different victims and uses plugins based on its current needs. Here is the summary list of all known
plugins at the moment:

fs

ps
ss

vsnet

rd
scan
grc

jn

cert

sn

tv
prx

dstr

kl
upd

searches for given file types, gets primary system and network

LDAP, FTP, POP3, IMAP, Telnet )

and driver level) at a certain time
keylogger
BE2 service file updater

usb

bios

gathers information on connected USBs  (Device instance ID,  drive
geometry)
gathers information on BIOS, motherboard, processor,  OS

We are pretty sure that our list of BE2 tools is not complete. For example, we have yet to obtain the router
access plugin, but we are confident that it exists. Evidence also supports the hypothesis that there is a
decryption plugin for victim files (see below).

Our current collection represents the BE2 attackers' capabilities quite well. Some plugins
remain mysterious and their purpose is not yet clear, like 'usb' and 'bios'. Why would the attackers need
information on usb and bios characteristics? It suggests that based on a specific USB and BIOS devices,
the attackers may upload specific plugins to carry out additional actions. Perhaps destructive, perhaps to
further infect devices. We don't know yet.

It's also interesting to point out another plugin – 'grc'. In some of the BE2 configuration files, we can
notice an value with a "gid" type:

The addr number in the config

This number is an ID for the plus.google.com service and is used by the 'grc' plugin to parse html. It then
downloads and decrypts a PNG file. The decrypted PNG is supposed to contain a new CNC address, but we
never observed one. We are aware of two related GooglePlus IDs. The first one,
plus.google.com/115125387226417117030/, contains an abnormal number of views. At the time of writing,
the count is 75 million:

BE2 plus profile

The second one - plus.google.com/116769597454024178039/posts - is currently more modest at a little
over 5,000 views. All of that account's posts are deleted.

Tracked Commands

During observation of the described above "router-PC" CnC we tracked the following commands delivered
in the config file before the server went offline. Our observation of related actions here:

DDoS on 212.175.109.10 (Linux, MIPS,  ARM)

The issued commands for the Linux plugins suggest the attackers controlled infected MIPS/ARM
devices. We want to pay special attention to the DDoS commands meant for these routers. 188.128.123.52
belongs to the Russian Ministry of Defense and 212.175.109.10 belongs to the Turkish Ministry of
Interior's government site. While many researchers suspect a Russian actor is behind BE2, judging by
their tracked activities and the victim profiles, it's still unclear whose interests they represent.

While observing some other CnCs and pulling down config files, we stumbled upon some strange mistakes
and mis-typing. They are highlighted in the image below:

BE2 config file mistakes

First, these mistakes suggest that the BE2 attackers manually edit these config files. Secondly, it shows
that even skilled hackers make mistakes.

Hard-Coded Command and Control

The contents of the config files themselves are fairly interesting. They all contain a callback c2 with a
hardcoded ip address, some contain timeouts, and some contain the commands listed above. We include a
list of observed hardcoded ip C2 addresses here, along with the address owner and geophysical location of
the host:

It's interesting that one of these servers is a Tor exit node. And, according to the collected config files, the
group upgraded their malware communications from plain text http to encrypted https in October 2013.

BE2 Targets and Victims

BlackEnergy2 victims are widely distributed geographically. We identified BlackEnergy2 targets and
victims in the following countries starting in late 2013. There are likely more victims.

Russia
Ukraine
Poland
Lithuania
Belarus
Azerbaijan
Kyrgyzstan
Kazakhstan
Iran
Israel
Turkey

Libya
Kuwait
Taiwan
Vietnam
India
Croatia
Germany
Belgium
Sweden

Victim profiles point to an expansive interest in ICS:

power generation site owners
power facilities construction
power generation operators
large suppliers and manufacturers of heavy power related materials
investors

However, we also noticed that the target list includes government, property holding, and technology
organizations as well:

high level government
other ICS construction
federal land holding agencies
municipal offices
federal emergency services
space and earth measurement and assessment labs
national standards body
banks
high-tech transportation
academic research

Victim cases

We gained insight into significant BE2 victim profiles over the summer of 2014. Interesting BE2 incidents
are presented here.

Victim #1

The BE2 attackers successfully spearphished an organization with an exploit for which there is no current
CVE, and a metasploit module has been available This email message contained a ZIP archive with EXE
file inside that did not appear to be an executable. This crafted zip archive exploited a WinRAR flaw that
makes files in zip archives appear to have a different name and file extension.

BE2 spearphish example

The attached exe file turned out to be 'BlackEnergy-like' malware, which researchers already dubbed
'BlackEnergy3' - the gang uses it along with BlackEnergy2. Kaspersky Lab detects 'BlackEnergy3' malware
as Backdoor.Win32.Fonten – naming it after its dropped file "FONTCACHE.DAT"

When investigating computers in the company's network, only BE2 associated files were found, suggesting
BE3 was used as only a first-stage tool on this network. The config files within BE2 contained the settings
of the company's internal web proxy:

BE2 config file contains victim's internal proxy

As the APT-specific BE2 now stores the downloaded plugins in encrypted files on the system (not seen in
older versions – all plugins were only in-memory), the administrators were able to collect BE2 files from
the infected machines. After decrypting these files, we could retrieve plugins launched on infected
machines: ps, vsnet, fs, ss, dstr. By all appearances, the attackers pushed the 'dstr' module when they
understood that they were revealed, and wanted to hide their presence on the machines. Some machines
already launched the plugin, lost their data and became unbootable.

Desstructive dstr command in BE2 config file

Also, on some machines, documents were encrypted, but no related plugin could be found.

Victim #2

The second organization was hacked via the first victim's stolen VPN credentials. After the second
organization was notified about the infection they started an internal investigation. They confirmed that
some data was destroyed on their machines, so the BE2 attackers have exhibited some level of destructive
activity. And, they revealed that their Cisco routers with different IOS versions were hacked. They weren't
able to connect to the routers any more by telnet and found the following "farewell" tcl scripts in the
router's file system:

Ciscoapi.tcl – contains various wrappers over cisco EXEC-commands as described in the comments.

The comment includes a punchy message for "kasperRsky":

BE2 ciscoapi.tcl fragment

Killint.tcl – uses Ciscoapi.tcl, implements destroying functions:

BE2 killint.tcl fragment

The script tries to download ciscoapi.tcl from a certain FTP server which served as a storage for BE2 files.
The organization managed to discover what scripts were hosted on the server before BE/SandWorm gang
deleted them, and unfortunately couldn't restore them after they were deleted. The BE2 actor performs
careful, professional activity covering their tracks:

ciscoapi.tcl
killint.tcl
telnetapi2.tcl
telnetu.tcl
stub.tcl
stub1.tcl

There is evidence that the logs produced by some scripts were also stored on the FTP server, in particular

the information on CDP neighbors which is provided by one of the procedures of ciscoapi.tcl.

Victim #3

The third organization got compromised by the same type of attack as the first one (an EXE file spoofing a
doc within a Zip archive). All the plugins discovered in BE2 files were known, and there was no revelation
of hacked network devices on their side and no destroyed data. The noticeable thing is that many
computers contained both BE2 and BE3 files and some config files contained the following URL:

hxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/f3395cd54cf857ddf8f2056768ff49ae/getcfg.php

The URL contains the md5 of the string 'router'. One of the discovered config files contained a URL with
an as yet unidentified md5:

hxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/bf0dac805798cc1f633f19ce8ed6382f/upgrade.php

Victim set #4

A set of victims discovered installed Siemens SCADA software in their ICS environment was responsible
for downloading and executing BlackEnergy. Starting in March 2014 and ending in July 2014, Siemens
"ccprojectmgr.exe" downloaded and executed a handful of different payloads hosted
at 94.185.85.122/favicon.ico. They are all detected as variants of "Backdoor.Win32.Blakken".

Build IDs

Each config file within BE2 main.dll has a field called build_id which identifies the malware version for
the operators. Currently this particular BE/SandWorm gang uses a certain pattern for the build ids
containing three hex numbers and three letters, as follows:

0C0703hji

The numbers indicate the date of file creation in the format: Year-Month-Day. Still, the purpose of the
letters is unknown, but most likely it indicates the targets. The hex numbers weren't used all the time,
sometimes we observed decimal numbers:

100914_mg

100929nrT

Most interesting for us was the earliest build id we could find. Currently it is "OB020Ad0V", meaning that
the BE2/SandWorm APT started operating as early as the beginning of 2010.

Appendix: IoC

While BE dropper installs its driver under a randomly picked non-used Windows driver name, like
%system32%\drivers\AliIde.sys. The driver is self-signed on 64-bit systems

However, new "APT" BE2 uses one of the following filenames that are used as an encrypted storage for
plugins and the network settings. They are consistent and serve as stable IoC:

%system32%\drivers\winntd_.dat
%system32%\drivers\winntd.dat
%system32%\drivers\wincache.dat
%system32%\drivers\mlang.dat
%system32%\drivers\osver32nt.dat
%LOCALAPPDATA%\adobe\wind002.dat
%LOCALAPPDATA%\adobe\settings.sol
%LOCALAPPDATA%\adobe\winver.dat
%LOCALAPPDATA%\adobe\cache.dat

BE2 also uses start menu locations for persistence:

Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\flashplayerapp.exe

BE3 uses the following known filenames:

%USERPROFILE%\NTUSER.LOG %LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT

BE2 MD5s:
