Vulnerability, malicious code appeared in the MBR destruction
function using Hangul file
Malware Information 2014/12/10 18:12
Vulnerabilities  recently  received  a  file  with  the  destruction  and  MBR  destruction  capabilities  for  major
extension to the existing file in addition to the backdoor functionality that existed in Hangul document file is
received attention is required.
December 9, 2014 received the first vulnerability Hangul document files were used for both groups known
vulnerabilities, patching does not work on the latest products. Total of 9 document file has been received, and
all of the same malicious file therein.

2. MBR destruction time

MBR destruction is done through a 'number' value of the registry key value of the items checked below ("0"
if  the  destructive  behavior  than  the  largest  value)  is  set  to  '0'  value  at  the  time  of  initial  infection.  The
following [Figure 1] shows the contents of the registry key 'PcaSvcc' items registered by the malware. MBR
destruction operations to determine the value of number entry through the time information of the user's
system after December 10, 2014 11:00 a.m. when a, is set to non-zero value is, the MBR is destroyed
feature to work .

In [Figure 2] shows a code section that compares the time information for determining a destruction inside
MBR infection. Malicious code stored in the internal "0x780D0C33" value and the operation to compare the
time information through a specific operation of the system time obtained by the GetLocalTime function call
can be seen that true.

3. MBR destruction techniques
MBR destruction is overwritten for the 0x200 (512 bytes), it can be seen the data filled in as shown in [Figure
3] below. Infection, 'A' ~ 'Z', the same process is repeated for all the drives.

The following [Figure 4] is overwritten with the contents of the MBR code, and has the ability to output the

Figure -3] MBR data

string during boot "Who Am I?".

The following [Figure 5] After MBR infection, a screen visible to the user reboots.

4. File destructive features
Malicious code can destroy the functionality of a file having a particular extension in addition to destruction
together also has functions for the MBR. Destroy the target file identified to date are:
- HWP 
- doc 

- PDF 
- docx 
- ALZ 
- ZIP 
- RAR 
- egg 
- iso 
- EXE 
- dll 
- sys
Locate the files with the extension of the above 'A' ~ 'Z' drive changes and performs a process to fill a NULL
value to 4096 bytes (4K) size.
 
5. Hangul vulnerability information
Received nine vulnerabilities Hangul document and the contents hereof are both used the same vulnerability
varies. In [Figure 6] shows the portion of the shell part and the operation code for generating a vulnerability.
The layout of paragraphs in Hangul document and vulnerability occurs in the course of processing the part
that  is  responsible  ('HWPTAG_PARA_LINE_SEG')  and,  shellcode  (ShellCode)  and  heap  spray  insert  a
paragraph of text for (Heap Spray) ('HWPTAG_PARA_TEXT') is used was.

7. Countermeasures
In order to prevent a malware infection is necessary to always maintain a
Hangul program, and program-to-date antivirus update state. In addition,
the  vulnerability  has  been  identified  as  Hangul  document  files  are
disseminated  in  the  form  of  a  person  to  e-mail  attachments.  For
unascertained  sender  or  unresolved  attachment,  the  procedure  to  ensure
that there is no problem in security is required before execution.
