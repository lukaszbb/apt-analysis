New Zero-Day Exploit targeting Internet Explorer Versions 9
through 11 Identified in Targeted Attacks

Summary

FireEye Research Labs identified a new Internet Explorer (IE) zero-day exploit used in targeted attacks.
 The vulnerability affects IE6 through IE11, but the attack is targeting IE9 through IE11.  This zero-day
bypasses both ASLR and DEP. Microsoft has assigned CVE-2014-1776 to the vulnerability and released
security advisory to track this issue.

Threat actors are actively using this exploit in an ongoing campaign which we have named “Operation
Clandestine Fox.” However, for many reasons, we will not provide campaign details. But we believe this is
a significant zero day as the vulnerable versions represent about a quarter of the total browser market. We
recommend applying a patch once available.
According to NetMarket Share, the market share for the targeted versions of IE in 2013 were:

IE 9      13.9%
IE 10    11.04%
IE 11     1.32%

Collectively, in 2013, the vulnerable versions of IE accounted for 26.25% of the browser market.  The
vulnerability, however, does appear in IE6 through IE11 though the exploit targets IE9 and higher.

The Details

The exploit leverages a previously unknown use-after-free vulnerability, and uses a well-known Flash
exploitation technique to achieve arbitrary memory access and bypass Windows’ ASLR and DEP
protections.

Exploitation

• Preparing the heap

The exploit page loads a Flash SWF file to manipulate the heap layout with the common technique heap
feng shui. It allocates Flash vector objects to spray memory and cover address 0×18184000. Next, it
allocates a vector object that contains a flash.Media.Sound() object, which it later corrupts to pivot control
to its ROP chain.

• Arbitrary memory access

The SWF file calls back to Javascript in IE to trigger the IE bug and overwrite the length field of a Flash
vector object in the heapspray. The SWF file loops through the heapspray to find the corrupted vector
object, and uses it to again modify the length of another vector object. This other corrupted vector object is
then used for subsequent memory accesses, which it then uses to bypass ASLR and DEP.

• Runtime ROP generation

With full memory control, the exploit will search for ZwProtectVirtualMemory, and a stack pivot (opcode
0×94 0xc3) from NTDLL. It also searches for SetThreadContext in kernel32, which is used to clear the
debug registers. This technique, documented here, may be an attempt to bypass protections that use
hardware breakpoints, such as EMET’s EAF mitigation.

With the addresses of the aforementioned APIs and gadget, the SWF file constructs a ROP chain, and
prepends it to its RC4 decrypted shellcode. It then replaces the vftable of a sound object with a fake one
that points to the newly created ROP payload. When the sound object attempts to call into its vftable, it
instead pivots control to the attacker’s ROP chain.

• ROP and Shellcode

The ROP payload basically tries to make memory at 0×18184000 executable, and to return to 0x1818411c
to execute the shellcode.

0:008> dds eax
18184100  770b5f58 ntdll!ZwProtectVirtualMemory
18184104  1818411c
18184108  ffffffff
1818410c  181840e8
18184110  181840ec
18184114  00000040
18184118  181840e4

Inside the shellcode, it saves the current stack pointer to 0×18181800 to safely return to the caller.

mov     dword ptr ds:[18181800h],ebp

Then, it restores the flash.Media.Sound vftable and repairs the corrupted vector object to avoid
application crashes.

18184123 b820609f06      mov     eax,69F6020h
18184128 90              nop

18184129 90              nop
1818412a c700c0f22169    mov     dword ptr [eax],offset 
Flash32_11_7_700_261!AdobeCPGetAPI+0x42ac00 (6921f2c0)
18184133 b800401818      mov     eax,18184000h
18184138 90              nop
18184139 90              nop
1818413a c700fe030000    mov     dword ptr [eax],3FEh 
ds:0023:18184000=3ffffff0

The shellcode also recovers the ESP register to make sure the stack range is in the current thread stack
base/limit.

18184140 8be5            mov     esp,ebp
18184142 83ec2c          sub     esp,2Ch
18184145 90              nop
18184146 eb2c            jmp     18184174

The shellcode calls SetThreadContext to clear the debug registers. It is possible that this is an attempt to
bypass mitigations that use the debug registers.

18184174 57              push    edi
18184175 81ece0050000    sub     esp,5E0h
1818417b c7042410000100  mov     dword ptr [esp],10010h
18184182 8d7c2404        lea     edi,[esp+4]
18184186 b9dc050000      mov     ecx,5DCh
1818418b 33c0            xor     eax,eax
1818418d f3aa            rep stos byte ptr es:[edi]
1818418f 54              push    esp
18184190 6afe            push    0FFFFFFFEh
18184192 b8b308b476      mov     eax,offset kernel32!SetThreadContext 
(76b408b3)
18184197 ffd0            call    eax

The shellcode calls URLDownloadToCacheFileA to download the next stage of the payload, disguised as
an image.

Mitigation

Using EMET may break the exploit in your environment and prevent it from successfully controlling your

computer. EMET versions 4.1 and 5.0 break (and/or detect) the exploit in our tests.
Enhanced Protected Mode in IE breaks the exploit in our tests. EPM was introduced in IE10.
Additionally, the attack will not work without Adobe Flash. Disabling the Flash plugin within IE will
prevent the exploit from functioning.

Threat Group History

The APT group responsible for this exploit has been the first group to have access to a select number of
browser-based 0-day exploits (e.g. IE, Firefox, and Flash) in the past. They are extremely proficient at
lateral movement and are difficult to track, as they typically do not reuse command and control
infrastructure. They have a number of backdoors including one known as Pirpi that we previously
discussed here. CVE-2010-3962, then a 0-day exploit in Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 dropped the Pirpi
payload discussed in this previous case.

As this is still an active investigation we are not releasing further indicators about the exploit at this time.
