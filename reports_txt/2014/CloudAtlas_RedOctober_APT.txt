Cloud Atlas: RedOctober APT is back in style

Two years ago, we published our research into RedOctober, a complex cyber-espionage operation
targeting diplomatic embassies worldwide. We named it RedOctober because we started this investigation
in October 2012, an unusually hot month.

After our announcement in January 2013, the RedOctober operation was promptly shut down and the
network of C&Cs was dismantled. As usually happens with these big operations, considering the huge
investment and number of resources behind it, they don't just "go away" forever. Normally, the group goes
underground for a few months, redesigns the tools and the malware and resume operations.

RedOctober Part 2

Since January 2013, we've been on the lookout for a possible RedOctober comeback. One possible hit was
triggered when we observed Mevade, an unusual piece of malware that appeared late in 2013. The Mevade
C&C name styles as well as some other technical similarities indicated a connection to RedOctober, but the
link was weak. It wasn't until August 2014 that we observed something which made us wonder if
RedOctober is back for good.

Meet Cloud Atlas

In August 2014, some of our users observed targeted attacks with a variation of CVE-2012-0158 and an
unusual set of malware. We did a quick analysis of the malware and it immediately stood out because of
certain unusual things that are not very common in the APT world.

Some of the filenames used in the attacks included:

FT - Ukraine Russia's new art of war.doc
Катастрофа малайзийского лайнера.doc
Diplomatic Car for Sale.doc
МВКСИ.doc
Organigrama Gobierno Rusia.doc
Фото.doc

Информационное письмо.doc

Письмо_Руководителям.doc
Прилож.doc
Car for sale.doc
Af-Pak and Central Asia's security issues.doc

At least one of them immediately reminded us of RedOctober, which used a very similarly named 
spearphish: "Diplomatic Car for Sale.doc". As we started digging into the operation, more details emerged
which supported this theory.

Perhaps the most unusual fact was that the Microsoft Office exploit didn't directly write a Windows PE
backdoor on disk. Instead, it writes an encrypted Visual Basic Script and runs it.

Cloud Atlas exploit payload - VBScript

This VBScript drops a pair of files on disk - a loader and an encrypted payload. The loader appears to be
different every time and internal strings indicate it is "polymorphically" generated. The payload is always
encrypted with a unique key, making it impossible to decrypt unless the DLL is available.

We observed several different spear-phishing documents that drop uniquely named payloads. For
instance, the "qPd0aKJu.vbs" file MD5:

E211C2BAD9A83A6A4247EC3959E2A730 drops the following files:

DECF56296C50BD3AE10A49747573A346 - bicorporate - encrypted payload
D171DB37EF28F42740644F4028BCF727 - ctfmonrn.dll - loader

The VBS also adds a registry key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ setting the
key "bookstore" to the value "regsvr32 %path%\ctfmonrn.dll /s", which ensures the malware runs every
time at system boot.

Some of the DLL names we observed include:

f4e15c1c2c95c651423dbb4cbe6c8fd5 - bicorporate.dll
649ff144aea6796679f8f9a1e9f51479 - fundamentive.dll

f5476728deb53fe2fa98e6a33577a9da - steinheimman.dll

The payload includes an encrypted configuration block which contains information about the C&C sever:

The information from the config includes a WebDAV URL which is used for connections, a username and
password, two folders on the WebDAV server used to store plugins/modules for the malware and where
data from the victim should be uploaded.

C&C communication

The Cloud Atlas implants utilize a rather unusual C&C mechanism. All the malware samples we've seen
communicate via HTTPS and WebDav with the same server "cloudme.com", a cloud services provider.
According to their website, CloudMe is owned and operated by CloudMe AB, a company based in
Linköping, Sweden.

(Important note: we do not believe that CloudMe is in any way related to the Cloud Atlas group - the
attackers simply create free accounts on this provider and abuse them for command-and-control).

Each malware set we have observed so far communicates with a different CloudMe account though. The
attackers upload data to the account, which is downloaded by the implant, decrypted and interpreted. In
turn, the malware uploads the replies back to the server via the same mechanism. Of course, it should be
possible to reconfigure the malware to use any Cloud-based storage service that supports WebDAV.

Here's a look at one such account from CloudMe:

The data from the account:

The files stored in the randomly named folder were uploaded by the malware and contain various things,
such as system information, running processes and current username. The data is compressed with LZMA
and encrypted with AES, however, the keys are stored in the malware body which makes it possible to
decrypt the information from the C&C.

We previously observed only one other group using a similar method – ItaDuke – that connected to
accounts on the cloud provider mydrive.ch.

Similarities with RedOctober

Just like with RedOctober, the top target of Cloud Atlas is Russia, followed closely by Kazakhstan,
according to data from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN). Actually, we see an obvious overlap of
targets between the two, with subtle differences which closely account for the geopolitical
changes in the region that happened during the last two years.

Interestingly, some of the spear-phishing documents between Cloud Atlas and RedOctober seem to exploit
the same theme and were used to target the same entity at different times.

Both Cloud Atlas and RedOctober malware implants rely on a similar construct, with a loader and the final
payload that is stored encrypted and compressed in an external file. There are some important differences
though, especially in the encryption algorithms used – RC4 in RedOctober vs AES in Cloud Atlas.

The usage of the compression algorithms in Cloud Altas and RedOctober is another interesting similarity.
Both malicious programs share the code for LZMA compression algorithm. In CloudAtlas it is used to
compress the logs and to decompress the decrypted payload from the C&C servers, while in Red October
the "scheduler" plugin uses it to decompress executable payloads from the C&C.

It turns out that the implementation of the algorithm is identical in both malicious modules, however the
way it is invoked is a bit different, with additional input sanity checks added to the CloudAtlas version.

Another interesting similarity between the malware families is the configuration of the build system used
to compile the binaries. Every binary created using the Microsoft Visual Studio toolchain has a special
header that contains information about the number of input object files and version information of the
compilers used to create them, the "Rich" header called so by the magic string that is used to identify it in
the file.

We have been able to identify several RedOctober binaries that have "Rich" headers describing exactly the
same layout of VC 2010 + VC 2008 object files. Although this doesn't necessarily mean that the binaries
were created on the same development computer, they were definitely compiled using the same version of
the Microsoft Visual Studio up to the build number version and using similar project configuration.

Finally, perhaps the strongest connection comes from targeting. Based on observations from KSN, some
of the victims of RedOctober are also being targeted by CloudAtlas. In at least one case, the
victim's computer was attacked only twice in the last two years, with only two malicious
programs – RedOctober and Cloud Atlas.

These and other details make us believe that CloudAtlas represents a rebirth of the RedOctober attacks.

Conclusion

Following big announcements and public exposures of targeted attack operations, APT groups behave in a
predictable manner. Most Chinese-speaking attackers simply relocate C&C servers to a different place,
recompile the malware and carry on as if nothing happened.

Other groups that are more nervous about exposure go in a hibernation mode for months or years. Some
may never return using the same tools and techniques.

However, when a major cyber-espionage operation is exposed, the attackers are unlikely to completely
shut down everything. They simply go offline for some time, completely reshuffle their tools and return
with rejuvenated forces.

We believe this is also the case of RedOctober, which makes a classy return with Cloud
Atlas.
