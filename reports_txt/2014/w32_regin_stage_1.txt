In this document we analyze a set of 32-bit samples 
which represents stage #1 of the complex threat that is 
known as Regin. Based on our analysis of the malware’s 
functionalities, this part of the Regin threat can be 
considered just a support module — its sole purpose 
is to facilitate and enable the operations of stage #2 
by loading it and making it more difficult to detect by 
security products.

Regin’s stage #1 targets the Windows platform and 
support various versions of the operating system, 
beginning with Windows NT 4.0. Based on our analysis, 
the samples may be classified into two categories: “pure” 
samples that do not feature any extra, non-malicious 
code; and “augmented” ones which feature malware 
code as part of another device driver. The existence of 
“augmented” samples indicates the intention of the 
attacker to remain undiscovered for as long as possible. 

When activated, samples of Regin stage #1 will 
retrieve encrypted content from specific locations of 
an already compromised system, map it into kernel 
memory and transfer control to it. In terms of technical 
sophistication, stage #1’s import resolution process is 
of particular interest, as the malware uses the unusual 
“trampoline” technique to mask the payload’s access to 
API functions.

It is clear that this support component, that represents 
the initial stage of a very complex threat, has been 
instrumental in securing long-term persistence in the 
attacks that made use of this threat.

1.  introDUCtion

In this document we describe the technical characteristics 
of a set of 27 32-bit samples of Regin’s stage #1 component. 

We first extract and collect a set of high level information 
from these samples to obtain a general overview of their 
structure. Based on this overview, we propose using two 
distinct grouping criteria to facilitate working with these 
samples. A single sample is then selected and analysed in 
detail; its functionalities are isolated and presented here, 
together with relevant portions of its code. 

1.1  sample statistics

Our analysis covers a collected set of 27 32-bit Portable 
Executable (PE) files for the Microsoft Windows operating 
system. All 27 samples are device drivers, designed to work 
at the kernel level.

Based on the code structure of the samples, they can be 
roughly categorized into two groups: 

 y “Pure” — does not feature any extra code beside the 

malicious one

 y “Augmented” — the malware code is present in 

combination with code from a legitimate device driver

Some “augmented” samples seem to be derived from 
Microsoft device drivers, with modifications to drive the 
execution towards the malicious code.

Of the 27 samples, 20 of them (or 74%) are “pure”; only 7 
samples can be classified as are “augmented”. Despite the 
small amount of samples at our disposal, it is possible to 
speculate that the disproportion between the number of 
“pure” and “augmented” samples reflects the additional 
complexity associated with creating the “augmented” 
samples. Another possibility is that “augmented” samples 
represent a particular stage of development or have 
served a particular purpose, and for this reason they are 
fewer in number; this suspicion might be confirmed by the 
compilation date as extracted from the samples’ PE header.

Analysis of the resources also shows that the “augmented” 
binaries are masked as binaries for Windows NT 5.2.3790, 
also known as Windows Server 2003. This hints to the 
fact that the attackers might have used these samples to 
specifically target machines running this particular version 
of Windows.

It also interesting to consider the filenames of the samples 
as they were observed in the wild or during submission for 
analysis. In 12 cases (44% of samples), the decoy names used 
by the files was “usbclass.sys”. [1] This particular name was 
used only for “pure” samples (though not all such samples 
used this name). It is our opinion that this particular name 
was selected to allay any suspicions on the victim’s part, if 
the file was discovered. 

Following detailed analysis of a selected reference sample 
(presented in later sections), we were able to group samples 
based on differences in their code from the analysed 
sample. We define the distance function between our 
reference sample and other samples as:

d(sample)〖:〖=  

|〖functions〖sample reference ∩ functionssample |

|〖functions〖sample〖reference |

Using this metric, we determined there were three 
categories among the 27 samples at our disposal. A set of 13 
samples out of 26 [2], which was assigned the label “variant 
#1”, alongside the reference sample, were extremely close 
to the reference, with distances between 89% and 100%. 7 
out of 26 samples (labelled “variant #2”) were very distant 
from the reference sample [3], with a consistent distance 
of 2.63%. Finally, the last 7 samples (labelled “variant #3”) 
showed distances between 41% and 53% from the reference 
sample. While samples belonging to “variant #2” or “variant 
#3” were not analyzed in detail, preliminary analysis shows 
that they all possess the same functionalities, but their code 
is notably different at the function level.

A final observation is that all the “augmented” samples 
belong to “variant #1”, according to this classification 
method. The full data matrix regarding the samples is 
provided in Appendix A for the interested reader.

2.  Malware analysis

This section presents a detailed analysis of a selected 
sample from the set of samples for Regin’s stage #1, which 
later serves as a reference for further analysis of other 
samples.

1     There exists a small number of references to a Logitech device driver with the name “usbclass.sys”. Were these 
references to be correct, it could be speculated that the malware authors may have wanted to use a name that 
would survive a simple investigation attempt done by, say, using an internet search engine.

Chart 1: Flowchart of content retrieval logic

2.1  Deployment and startup

At the time of writing, it is not known how the Regin 
stage #1 samples are deployed to the target system. Our 
analysis of the samples’ system interactions showed no 
evidence to indicate that they are any different from other 
device drivers; we therefore believe that these samples are 
installed, registered and invoked as with any other device 
driver.

2.2  sample selection

The analysis in this section focuses on the sample with MD5 
26297dc3cd0b688de3b846983c5385e5, which was chosen 
for two reasons: first, the sample was among the first few 

we retrieved, and second, it was the only “pure” sample in 
that particular set. A “pure” sample has the advantage of 
being self-contained, smaller in size and independent from 
any other code.

2.3  Content retrieval

Almost immediately after receiving control, the malware’s 
code will attempt to locate its payload from the already 
infected system. The malware will scan selected locations 
in both the file system and the registry. These locations 
are hardcoded inside the binary itself under a layer of 
simple encryption. The logic for content retrieval can be 
represented by a simplified flowchart (Chart 1). 

       2   The total number of samples is 26 because the reference sample has been excluded.  

3   It is clear that d (sample reference) = 1.

Image 1: Content decryption loop

Image 2: Payload verification code

2.4  retrieval from the file system (extended 
attributes)

content is simply the value of the provided key/value-name 
combination. 

Regin’s stage #1 component relies on the concept of 
‘Extended Attributes’ to store its payload on the file-system. 
Extended Attributes are a list of name-value pairs that can 
be associated to New Technology File System (NTFS) files 
and directories. 

The malware retrieves the list of extended attributes 
associated with the provided full path to a directory or file. 
This list is then iterated and each element is inspected. The 
malware expects to retrieve the content from extended 
attributes named as “_”. If that condition is met, the value 
is then extracted. It should be noted that the content may 
be split between extended attributes belonging to two 
different NTFS objects. An example file-system location is 
the following:

                                      <WINDOWS>\Cursors

The use of Extended Attributes was not observed in 
malware until the recent emergence of the ZeroAccess 
rootkit [4].  As the Regin threat appears to have emerged 
earlier than ZeroAccess however, we are convinced that 
significant skills, knowledge and resources were available to 
the developers of Regin to enable earlier use of this unusual 
technique. 

2.5  retrieval from the registry

If Regin’s stage #1 is unable to retrieve payload content 
from the file-system, the malware will turn its attention to 
the registry. Regin’s stage #1 malware samples contain a 
hardcoded registry path and value name to be used as a fall-
back location for content retrieval. In this case, the sought 

An example registry location is:

\REGISTRY\Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\

Control\RestoreList:VideoBase

If both content retrieval attempts are unsuccessful, the 
malware will not perform any additional operation until 
its next invocation, when it will again attempt to retrieve 
content from either the file-system or the registry.

2.6  Decryption 

The encryption used to protect the content in the file 
system or registry is a XOR based algorithm, specific to 
this malware family. Regin’s stage #1 body contains the key 
needed for payload decryption. The code for the payload’s 
decryption routine is presented in Image 1.

After decryption, the malware quickly verifies the payload is 
correct, in order to avoid attempting to map something for 
execution when it is obviously invalid (Image 2).

2.7  Content mapping

Once the payload is in clear text, Regin’s stage #1 proceeds 
to map it so that it can be executed. The mapping process 
follows the logic of the operating system’s PE loader. 

Regin’s stage #1 PE loader is quite comprehensive; 
considering the suspected age of the threat, the generic 
nature of the PE loader and the fact that the PE loading 
happens completely in kernel mode, we can speculate that 
the authors of this threat are skilled and well-funded.

Image 3: Code recovered for the QuickPeParse function

2.8  the Quickpeparse function 

Of particular interest is a specific helper function that 
is widely used by Regin’s stage #1 in association with PE 
manipulation. 

simplifying the code and avoiding dangerous mistakes. This 
is, again, possibly additional confirmation of the attacker’s 
skills. 

2.9  Header and sections

The helper function quickly verifies the validity of a PE file, 
while at the same time recovering information (Image 3) 
useful to anyone willing to load or programmatically process 
a PE file. 

Given the number of times Regin’s stage #1 needs to retrieve 
PE-related information, this subroutine is a great help in 

This part of the loading process is performed in a fairly 
standard way. Regin’s stage #1 begins the loading process by 
verifying that its payload is a valid PE file. If this verification 
is successful, the malware retrieves the value of the 
SizeOfImage field from the OptionalHeader of the PE file, 
then allocates a number of bytes equivalent to this value. 

5

Image 4: Calculating the delta

Image 5: Missing replacements for mem* functions

The payload will be mapped to this memory region. 

Before proceeding any further, Regin’s stage #1 calculates 
the delta (Image 4) between the address of the memory 
region it allocated for the memory mapped image and the 
preferred ImageBase retrieved from the OptionalHeader. 
This information will be used later during the mapping 
process, in case relocations need to be processed.

With these operations completed, the headers are mapped 
first, followed sequentially by each of the PE file sections. 
This process is relatively straightforward. 

It is to be appreciated that the majority of the operations 
described above rely at some level on QuickPeParse’s 
results.

On another note, in this section of the code we begin to see 
references to missing replacements for mem* functions. 

The absence of the mem* replacements does not affect 
the malware’s ability to proceed with the execution, as the 
code falls back to standard API functions (Image 5). Such 
code constructs are encountered extensively throughout 
the remainder of the code. Our opinion on this matter is 
that the replacement functions would provide augmented 
logging when dealing with memory operations; their 
absence is possibly the result of conditional compilation. 
Such an explanation would further the belief that the 
authors of this malware are experienced developers. 

2.10  imports & trampolines

pieces of code, eventually triggering the requested external 
subroutine before finally returning to the payload.

Before getting into details, it is important to have an idea of 
how the trampolines work from a high-level perspective. 

A trampoline transition can be summarized as follows: 

1.  Payload invokes “resolved” external subroutine
2.  Trampoline code receives control

a.  Trampoline code retrieves the previously-

resolved real address of the external subroutine

b.  Trampoline invokes the pre-API call code

3.  Pre-API call code prepares the environment to make 

the function call return to trusted location inside 
trusted module

a.  Pre-API call code invokes the external 

subroutine

4.  External subroutine performs its duty

a.  External subroutine returns

5.  Execution lands in appropriate part of trusted 

module

6.  Jump to post-API call code is executed
7.  Post-API call code receives control

a.  Post-API call code restores the environment for 

payload

b.  Post-API call code transfers control back to 

payload, as would normally happen after a call 
to an external subroutine

8.  Payload continues its operations

Import resolution is the crucial part for achieving Regin 
stage #1’s goal of hiding the originator of system calls 
from external observers. The loader will correctly resolve 
the address of imported functions, but will embed these 
addresses in so-called ‘trampoline’ code. Addresses to 
the trampolines are instead added to the Import Address 
Table (IAT). From there, the execution will traverse different 

In the following subsections we will discuss the details 
of how the malware retrieves and pieces together all the 
information required to produce and install the trampolines. 

Appendix B contains a diagram detailing a complete 
transition between the payload and an external module 
exporting a function.

2.10.1  embedded code templates

The stage #1 malware uses predefined code for pre-API-call 
and post-API-call operations. This code is embedded in 
the binary and is almost ready for use, but it requires some 
customization to account for differences when it comes to 
memory addresses. 

The malware is aware of the start address of both pieces 
of code inside its own body, and has a rough idea of the 
size of the two code portions. The builder code contains 
wrong values for the size of both templates. This is most 
likely a remnant of a previous code version that contained 
templates that were bigger. 

With this information, the malware scans those sections of 
code looking for specific DWORDs that mark locations that 
need customization.

As an example, we report a screenshot of the post-API-
call code (Image 6). The value of 0x99119911 as the second 
operand of the last instruction in this code portion is a 
placeholder that acts as a marker for the builder code.

The offset of the values needing customization are marked 
by the values: 

 y pre-API-call code: 

◊  0x66116611
◊  0x77117711
◊  0x88118811

 y post-API-call code:

◊  0x99119911

Image 6: Post-API-call code

The addresses of such markers relative to the beginning of 
the owner code portion are recorded for later use. After all 
the information is recorded, Regin’s stage #1 copies both 
the pre-API-call and the post-API-call code portions to 
newly allocated memory regions.

2.10.2  locating a safe location inside a trusted 
module

For the trampolines to be successful, a safe location inside 
a trusted kernel module needs to be found. After the 
trampolines are in place, the affected module will be the 
one that is seen and “blamed” by an external observer every 
time the payload executes a call to an external subroutine.

To find this location, Regin’s stage #1 scans all the sections 
that are executable and non pageable from a set of trusted 
modules. This set of modules includes: 

 y NTOSKRNL.EXE
 y HAL.dll
 y Disk.sys
 y Atapi.sys

These memory regions are scanned for a specific set of 
bytes. The sought after combinations are listed below, 
together with their assembly representation. 

 y 0xFF, 0x26: jmp dword ptr [esi]
 y 0xFF, 0x27: jmp dword ptr [edi]
 y 0xFF, 0x66: jmp dword ptr [esi+bb]
 y 0xFF, 0x67: jmp dword ptr [edi+bb]
 y 0xFF, 0xA6: jmp dword ptr [esi+dddddddd]
 y 0xFF, 0xA7: jmp dword ptr [edi+dddddddd]
 y 0xFF, 0xE6: jmp esi
 y 0xFF, 0xE7: jmp edi

The assembler representations make the malware’s purpose 
quite clear. The malware will arrange for the system call to 
return to this particular location inside a trusted module, 
fooling any external observer who may be monitoring the 
return address to identify the module originating the call to 
the external subroutine. Executing the code at this location 
will make the CPU execute the jump operation, which will 
eventually lead back to the payload’s code. 

If any of the two bytes sequences presented above is found 
in the code of a trusted module, and if the surrounding 
code passes further safety checks, its address is recorded. 

Depending on the specific byte combination found, 
additional information may be retrieved or calculated; for 
example, in the case of a jmp dword ptr [edi+xxxxxxxx], the 
immediate part of the operand is retrieved for calculating 
the delta between that value and the location containing 
the address of the post-API-call. The calculated delta value 
will be assigned to the EDI register so that the execution will 
flow smoothly.

7

Image 7: Trampoline memory allocation

If none of these sequences are found, the search continues 
in other sections and trusted modules. If no suitable 
location is available, Regin’s stage #1 will simply terminate its 
execution.

2.10.3  Code template customization

Once the safe location in a trusted module has been located 
and its address and type retrieved, Regin’s stage #1 can 
customize the copies of the pre- and post-API-call code 
templates.

Each of the values is customized as follows: 

 y 0x66116611: delta value to be applied to ESI/EDI register 
so that the jump instruction at the safe location will lead 
the execution back to the post-API-call code
 y 0x77117711: address of the safe jump location
 y 0x88118811: nothing, used only as an end marker
 y 0x99119911: not specifically replaced, but parts of it are 

overwritten with the address of post-API-call code if the 
safe location involves an indirect jump

2.10.4  trampolines

Trampolines are the mechanism that Regin’s stage #1 uses to 
reroute the execution through several pieces of code every 
time the payload executes a call to an external function. 
There exists a trampoline for each individual imported 
function, and the trampolines are stored sequentially in 
memory and accessed as an array.

Each trampoline is constructed from the following 
template:

 y d2d2d2d2: replaced with the offset of the pre-API-call 
code segment, relative to the instruction after the jmp

During import resolution, each item to resolve is fetched 
and its address retrieved. The address is then used to fill 
a trampoline as described above. Finally, the address of 
the trampoline is added to the IAT of the module being 
mapped in place of the resolved address. Please note that, 
as is logical, this process is only executed for symbols 
whose address lies in a section that is flagged as executable. 
Other symbols are not protected by trampolines and their 
addresses are added directly to the IAT. 

The described trampoline mechanism clearly provides 
transparent protection to the payload.

2.11  the Codeprotection structure

This structure links together all the pieces involved with the 
protection of the payload. It is added, for example, to the 
payload’s data directory information and it is used for most 
of the computations performed by Regin’s stage #1. The 
structure is defined as follows:

Image 8: CodeProtection structure

  mov eax, d1d1d1d1 

jmp $+d2d2d2d2

2.12  relocations

The values “d1d1d1d1” and “d2d2d2d2” are placeholders that 
will be replaced during actual import resolution with the 
relevant information. In particular, the two values will be 
replaced with the following information: 

 y d1d1d1d1: replaced with the address of the external 
function from the third party module (for example: 
NTOSKRNL.EXE!memcpy)

The next step of the payload loading process is for the 
malware to process the possible relocations of the mapped 
payload.

To carry out this operation, the dedicated code needs 
to process the base relocation table for the payload. 
Additionally, it makes use of the previously calculated delta 
between the current image base and the preferred image 
loading address.

8

Image 9: Scanning the payload’s DATA_DIRECTORIES

The PE loader supports only two specific base relocation 
types, IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW and IMAGE_REL_
BASED_DIR64. However, this level of support is enough 
to guarantee the loading of binaries produced by recent 
toolchains. 

As a matter of fact, the loader’s support of the relocation 
type IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64 gives us the firsts hint 
that a 64-bit version of the Regin framework may exist, in 
combination with 64-bit additional stages.

2.13  Finalizing the loading process

As the final step in the loading process, the malware 
scans the payload’s DATA_DIRECTORIES to perform a final 
modification to the mapped image.

The modification consists of setting the VirtualAddress 
of the selected DATA_DIRECTORY to the address of the 
previously mentioned CodeInjection structure. Additionally, 
the Size field of the selected DATA_DIRECTORY is set to a 

9

special value, 0xFEDCBAFE (renamed MALWARE_MARKER_
DATA_DIR_SIZE in Image 9). 

3.  ConClUsions

A suitable DATA_DIRECTORY is one which satisfies the 
following conditions: 

 y The particular data directory is not in use 

(VirtualAddress and Size must be 0)

 y The directory should not be among the following 

directories:
◊  EXPORT
◊  IMPORT
◊  IMPORT ADDRESS TABLE (IAT)
◊  DELAY-LOAD IMPORT TABLE 

It is clear that the malware selects the data directory 
with special care, specifically to avoid interference 
with interactions between the mapped payload and its 
dependencies. 

2.14  invocation of stage #2

With the payload fully mapped into memory and the 
trampoline mechanism set up to mask the malware’s access 
to external subroutines, Regin’s stage #1 is ready to transfer 
control to the next stage.

This is done by calculating the address of stage #2’s entry 
point and calling that location.

Our analysis of the Regin’s stage #1, as detailed in this 
document, shows that this component of the Regin 
framework is designed to retrieve an additional payload 
(stage #2) from an already compromised system, map it into 
kernel memory and execute it. 

During the loading process, Regin’s stage #1 will hide 
the payload’s invocations of function exported by other 
modules using an unusual ‘trampoline’ mechanism. In this 
way, the malware manages to effectively fool an external 
observer into thinking that calls to API functions are being 
performed by one of a set of ‘trusted’ modules, thereby 
allaying suspicion of the payload’s activities.

The utilitarian nature of the malware makes it obvious that 
this is a support module, designed to hide the presence of 
an additional stage.

Attempting attribution based on this single component 
is particularly challenging, as Regin’s stage #1 is purely 
a support module, with very little content other than 
executable code. In the case of the “augmented” samples, 
the benign device driver used as a base offers little to 
nothing in terms of information that could help identifying 
the author(s). 

That said, based on the code structure, we suspect that 
Regin’s developers may be experienced and skilled. 
Statistical analysis of the 27 samples in our collection 
suggest that the three different types of stage #1 samples 
we identified may have been the product of iterative 
development. 

The fact that the malware supports even Windows NT4 
targets suggests that this malware is designed to work 
against a wide set of targets, each running different versions 
of the Windows operating system in their environment. We 
believe however that at some point the attackers directed 
their efforts towards machines running Windows NT 
5.2.3790, also known as Windows Server 2003.
