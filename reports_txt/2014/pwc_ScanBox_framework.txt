ScanBox framework – who’s affected, and who’s using it?

By Chris Doman and Tom Lancaster

Earlier this year the Japanese language website of one of the world’s largest suppliers of industrial
equipment was compromised by a sophisticated threat actor. Usually in such cases an attacker will use
their access to place an exploit kit on the compromised website, delivering malware to visitors - a
technique commonly referred to as setting up a ‘watering hole’ or ‘strategic web compromise’. In this case
however, rather than relying on malware, the exploit kit was a self-contained key logger that recorded all
keystrokes the user performed while on the website. AlienVault[1]  produced an excellent write-up on this
framework, which the developers named ScanBox.

ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn't require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in
order to steal information - the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be
executed by a web browser. The framework also facilitates reconnaissance, enabling attackers to exploit
vulnerabilities in visitors systems in a more traditional fashion, by pushing & executing malware.

Since the initial post made by AlienVault, we have been actively scouring the web for new instances of the
framework. In this blog, we’re going to discuss four other watering holes which use ScanBox:

Table 1 – Selected ScanBox compromises

Looking at who was being targeted, we noticed a reasonable variation, including targeting of the Uyghur
population in China, US Think Tanks, the Japanese Industrial sector & Korean hospitality. This variation
was our first clue that more than one actor may be using the framework (although on its own this would
not be enough - some actors do target a wide range of organisations, some also focus on specific
geographies or sectors).

To check if this was the case, we took a deeper dive into each version of the code.

The Framework

Whilst all four implementations share the same codebase, there are some minor differences in their
implementations.  These differences may show that different attackers are using the ScanBox framework.

We’ve outlined a few key differences we identified below:

Malicious code was delivered in a single block of JavaScript on both webmailgoogle[.]com and
foundationssl[.]com. The domains qoog1e[.]com and googlecaches[.]com selectively loaded extra plugins
from separate files:

 

Figure 1 – The JavaScript function to load additional plugins

We can see how these differ by comparing two exploit kits side by side:

                       

Figure 2 – foundationssl[.]com on the left loads JavaScript inline. qoog1e.com on the right loads
JavaScript from separate files

A motivation for selectively loading plugins is likely to be to prevent crashes or any errors appearing
(which may alert the compromised site’s owner) when the page is loaded – as some of the plugins are only
compatible with specific browsers. Selectively loading plugins has the added bonus of slightly reducing
access to the attacker’s code to researchers. Browsers the attackers are not interested in will be served the
following placeholder instead of the malicious function:

targeted browser

The following ScanBox plugins are deployed on code.googlecaches[.]com, dependent upon the users

There are further code differences too. Take for example the different implementations of software
enumeration, by identifying whether certain files exist:

 

Figure 4 – Software enumeration on googlecaches[.]com (left) and foundationssl[.]com (right)

From a developer’s perspective, I know it’s always a good idea to check the details of any exceptions that
occur when writing code in order to create more stable applications. It’s pleasing to see the ScanBox
developers using good coding practices, though only if they’re in the office!

 

Figure 5 – Highlighted section of code from Figure 3 (Plugin 1 on code.googlecaches[.]com)

When identifying the security software, only the implementation found on foundationssl[.]com employs
the full version of some publicly available code[5] (the section of code with informational messages such
as “"Folder was found!"”). In all other versions only a subsection of the same code is used.

At this point we’ve established that there are subtle variations between the ScanBox code deployed on
different websites, however this could be due to differences in the expected environment of the targets the
attackers wish to infect in each case, or upgrades to the framework.

Analysis of associated attacker infrastructure

In order to potentially group the activity observed together, we analysed network infrastructure associated
with the domains used by the attacker(s) deploying the ScanBox framework. Our analysis showed that
there was little overlap both in terms of associated infrastructure and in terms of the malware families
associated with that infrastructure.

Summaries of each cluster are given below, whilst full details of the components which made up each are
available in the Appendix.

We have been unable to identify any direct overlaps between the clusters, i.e. shared domains or IP
addresses, neither have we been able to determine any softer linkages beyond the reuse of the GoDaddy
registrar.

Of course this could be due to lack of data points available to us – we welcome any additional data points
the community are available to provide which show linkages between the clusters shown below.

Conclusions

In this post we’ve identified four affected websites, each of which would draw distinct audiences who
would be valuable to different actors. We’ve also taken a look at the variations in how the framework was
implemented, and found a few subtle differences in the implementations. Finally, we analysed the
associated infrastructure with the attacker domains used in each case, and found no overlap between the
clusters of activity.

In a similar fashion to our previous blog entry on potential overlap between APT1 and Putter Panda[6] ,
we can attempt to explain these differences with several hypotheses:

1.  The framework is used by a single group that target widely and upgrade or adapt their code for

different targets, and are careful to avoid any overlap in infrastructure or in services used.

2.  Selections of actors share some resources, as per previous observations with similar kits by some

security vendors[7].

3.  The exploit kits have been used by one group, and taken from public watering holes for their own

use by other unrelated persons

In our experience, very few attackers have the patience to maintain completely distinct infrastructure with
multiple registrars, name servers and hosting providers at the same time, therefore we have a low

confidence in hypothesis 1. In our view, the hypothesis with the highest probability is that groups of
attackers share resources leading to overlaps – this appears to be an ever more common feature – with
malware families, builders, and even sometimes hosting infrastructure being shared between disparate
actors with a common goal. Sharing frameworks like ScanBox or other exploit kits allows less
sophisticated actors (who were themselves unable to develop a tool like ScanBox) to conduct better
attacks.

[3] This employs code from “The Browser Hackers handbook” The plugins deployed on “qoogle.com” are
the same, though they utilise different plugin IDs – this may indicate that the framework allows you to
select which plugins you wish to deploy, and then the entire framework is ‘built’ by a builder.
