SandwormCampaign  - Attribution
Russian Cyber Espionage



Marked increase in cyber espionage activities linked to Russia 

–

–

Russia is increasing its cyber-espionage focus and the volume is up in 
2014 

iSIGHT recently detailed activities of Tsar Team 

 Mobile malware targeting multiple platforms 

–

Android, Windows, IOS 



Targets include

Foreign militaries

iSIGHT Partners believes 
Sandworm Team has Russian 
origins based on several 
factors:
Files retrieved from an open directory on 
a command and control server included 
a directory listing in Russian and a help 
file for the BlackEnergy Trojan also 
written in Russian

2

Known targeting is consistent with 
antagonists to NATO as well as Ukrainian 
and European Union governments.



Sandworm is one of 5 active cyber intrusion teams linked to Russia 
being monitored by iSIGHT Partners

–

–

–

Activities date back as far as 2009 

Identified through overlapping infrastructure, use of traditional 
crimeware, unique references to Dune 

Team has an affinity for using traditional cyber crime tools as a 
component of its activities  



BlackEnergy malware 

–

Used at least 2 versions of BlackEnergy 

»
»

BlackEnergy 2 – traditional crimeware 
BlackEnergy 3 (Lite) 

•

No documented use in crime – may have been 
purpose built for Sandworm 

–

Samples tied on basis of configuration to same combination of internal 
proxies 

•

Up to 7 proxies in common

Social engineering is designed to appeal to 
personnel involved in military and intelligence 
operations against Russia such as a list of pro-
Russian “terrorists” sent in an email.

BlackEnergy source code was released
through Russian e-crime channels.

against Georgia 

– Attributed to Eshkinkot – Russian national named Vladimir A. 

Lenskij

– Georgie CERT claimed to have captured e-mail messages and docs 

from Russian handlers
