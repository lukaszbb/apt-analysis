1. THE BUNNY DROPPER

Suspect #4 is the fourth out of a row of malware samples, which are believed to stem from 
the same malicious actor. Insights on the campaign were first presented at Hack.lu 
Conference 2014 in Luxembourg [8]. The name 'EvilBunny' is derived from a link to debug 
information embedded in the dropper binary of suspect #4. The path to the associated 
.pdb-file contains the name of the project and sub project, namely 'bunny 2.3.2' and 
'Transporter2'. 

Illustration 1: IDA Pro's request for the associated .pdb-file

EvilBunny has been seen spreading through a malicious PDF document, exploiting CVE-
2011-4369 on 20th of December 2011 [1]. The exploit would download the bunny dropper 
and install suspect #4 on the infected system. Both, dropper and payload were compiled 
on 25th of October 2011, while CVE-2011-4369 was released only on 16th of December. It 
is unclear as of when the attacks started; although, clearly, either the attackers adopted 
the vulnerability within 4 days or the attacks were performed using an AdobeReader 0-day.

The functionality of the dropper can be summarized in the following steps:

• Sandbox check and anti virus product enumeration
• Dropping payload 'netmgr.exe'
• Creating a registry key for persistence
• Creating a registry key for deletion of the dropper

Searching for a sandbox environment, the malware takes a number of simple steps to 
verify. It tests the module file name to see if it is less than 5 characters long or if it contains
either of the four strings 'klavme', 'myapp', 'TESTAPP' or 'afyjevmv.exe'. Also, it verifies if 
less than 15 processes are running in the environment, using the API call EnumProcesses.

page | 4

In case any of the conditions is met execution will abort. Up to the time of writing it remains
unclear which environment the mentioned strings aim to identify, if any.

Accessing the systems WMI
(Windows Management
Interface) the malware queries
the installed AntiVirus software
by issuing 'SELECT * FROM
AntiVirusProduct'. More
specifically, the malware is
interested in the data fields
'productUptoDate',
'VersionNumber', 'DisplayName'
and 'productState'. The
information about AntiVirus provided by WMI differs between Windows versions, so the 
requests address different namespaces, 'ROOT\SecurityCenter' for WindowsXP and 
'ROOT\SecurityCenter2' for Windows Vista and newer versions. 

     Illustration 2: The process count as environment check

Names of AntiVirus products are represented as hard coded SHA-256 hashes, namely the 
following:

f1761a5e3856dceb3e14d4555af92d3d1ac47604841f69fc72328b53ab45ca56 Kaspersky

Only three of the seven hashes were identified. If any of the indicated products is installed 
and active on the machine execution will abort.

The dropper comes with its payload attached in the resource section. The resource 
RCData contains the entire netmgr.exe binary; alleged suspect #4. The binary is dropped 
as netmgr.exe, either located in %APPDATA%\Perf Manager\ or %WINDIR%\msapps\. 
The final directory location depends whether the dropper is running with administrative 
privileges or not.

Interestingly, the dropper also changes the creation time stamp of the newly created binary
to time stamp of the system executable explorer.exe. This serves to avoid raising 
suspicion of a forensic analysts or tools.

As a means of persistence the dropper creates an entry under [HKLM|
HKCU]\...\CurrentVersion\Run which points to the dropped netmgr.exe binary. This 

page | 5

ensures that netmgr.exe will be executed every time the system boots. Furthermore, the 
dropper generates another entry in the Windows registry, under [HKLM|
HKCU]\Software\Microsoft\IPSec. This entry is named 'isakmpAutoNegociate' and points 
to the dropper binary. This key will be requested by netmgr.exe later to locate the dropper 
binary and delete it.

The naming of the key for cleanup of the dropper is chosen to confuse analysts, although 
the name is clearly misspelled.

Another interesting side fact is that the dropper does not start the dropped malware, 
neither does it contain code which could even do so. This implies, the final infection stage 
does not start unless the infected machine is rebooted. Also, the dropper binary will not be 
deleted in the meanwhile.

2. SUSPECT #4

Suspect #4 was the fourth discovered sample in a row of malware related to the EvilBunny
attacks; even before its dropper. Yet, it is by far the most interesting one. It is a multi-
threaded bot with an integrated scripting engine. It incorporates a Lua engine and 
downloads and executes Lua scripts to reach a certain level of polymorphism. The Lua 
scripts can call back into the C++ code to alter the malware behavior at runtime.

The malware seeks to keep a low profile on the infected machine, while executing the 
botmaster's commands and Lua scripts. In total Suspect #4 exhibits three different 
methods for receiving C&C input and executing commands; directly via HTTP, through a 
downloaded database file or as a scheduled task. Also, the malware will generate 
numerous files to help its execution and frequently reply back to the C&C with status 
messages. 

The initial purpose of the malware seems to be sharing execution load among infected 
host machines. However, due to the lack of the original Lua scripts and the extensive 
functionality of the embedded Lua engine the original intentions of the attackers remain 
unknown. 

2.1 MALWARE ANTI-ANALYSIS
Suspect #4 is written in C++, and just like its dropper, it is not protected by any runtime 
packer or crypter. It is, however, compiled with a performance optimization option which 
causes a lot of code in-lining and duplicate code in the binary. Duplication also applies to 
string constants, as every string is present once per function, if the given function uses it. 
This might accelerate execution speed of the bot at runtime, but implicitly or even on 
purpose hinders static analysis of the binary code. Cross referencing of strings or helper 
functions is ineffective due to the duplications. 

Only few anti-analysis measures can be found in the binary. One function exists, which 
resembles the sandbox check of its dropper with minor extensions. This sandbox detection
consists of three parts:

• The module path name should be more than 5 characters long and contain either 

'msapps\' or 'Perf Manager\', which is the case if the sample was legitimately 
dropped by its dropper.

• The module file name should not contain either of the following strings: 'klavme', 

'myapp', 'TESTAPP' or 'afyjevmv.exe'.

page | 7

• The function performs a hook detection on time retrieval APIs. These are 

NtQuerySystemTime, GetSystemTimeAsFileTime and GetTickCount. Every API is 
called twice to calculate a delta, while performing a sleep(1000) operation between 
iteration one and iteration two. The final condition is, if any of the three deltas is 
below 998 milliseconds execution will abort. This can only be the case if any of the 
three API's return values is modified by a system monitoring solution, like a 
sandbox. 

Illustration 3: Hook detection on time retrieval functions

Another evasion trick implemented by the malware is the partial obfuscation of API names.
For no obvious reason though, the obfuscation algorithm is only applied to a small subset 
of APIs used in the code. The algorithm uses the fixed value AB34CD77h and a 
combination of XOR and ROL
instructions to calculate hashes
from the export names of
kernel32.dll, advapi32.dll and
psapi.dll. It is important to note that
this obfuscation trick and the
according hash function remain
consistent through out all related
samples.

2.1.1 ENUMERATION OF FIREWALL AND ANTIVIRUS PRODUCTS

Similar to its dropper, suspect #4 enumerates the system's installed AntiVirus product and 
checks firewall settings. For AntiVirus detection it utilizes WMI and issues 'SELECT * 
FROM AntiVirusProduct'. Identification of installed products is achieved by comparing the 
hashed product name to a set of SHA-256 hashes; although, a different and much bigger 
set than used by its dropper. With the help of hash tables from perturb.org and 
md5decoder.org it is possible to revert some of the hashes to their original text form:

The malware retrieves the attributes 'productState', 'DisplayName' and on WindowsXP 
also 'productUptoDate'. It is noteworthy though, that for netmgr.exe the existence of any of 
the indicated AntiVirus products does not pose a reason to end execution. In fact, these 
hashes are the only measure for obfuscating strings in the binary. 

Firewall detection works equally via querying WMI through "SELECT * FROM 
FirewallProduct", while this time the malware searches for the attributes 'enabled', 
'VersionNumber' and 'DisplayName'.

AntiVirus and firewall information is stored in objects in a linked list at runtime. It will later 
either be exfiltrated to a C&C server directly or dumped to a local file on disk. Either way, 
the results of this check do not influence the flow of execution.

2.2 SYSTEM INFILTRATION
After start-up the malware aims to inject itself to an svchost.exe process. For stealthiness 
the malware can either inject itself as a remote thread to a running svchost.exe process or 
perform the same procedure on a newly created one. 

As a singular means of persistence the malware relies on the auto-start registry key 
created by its dropper under [HKLM|HKCU]\...\CurrentVersion\Run, which will start 
netmgr.exe on every system boot.

Also, the payload retrieves the dropper's path from 'isakmpAutoNegociate' under [HKLM|
HKCU]\Software\Microsoft\IPSec, then deletes the binary and the 'isakmpAutoNegociate' 
registry key.

2.3 CONFIGURATION AND COMMAND & CONTROL SETTINGS
At start-up netmgr.exe decrypts a configuration file stored in its resource section, revealing
three URLs, among timeout settings and encryption keys:

•
•
•

http://le-progres.net/images/php/test.php?rec=11206-01
http://ghatreh.com/skins/php/test.php?rec=11206-01
http://www.usthb-dz.org/includes/php/test.php?rec=11206-01

All three of these URLs served as C&C contacts when the attack was still ongoing, 
sending commands or Lua scripts to the infected host. Interesting is that two of the 
domains are actual fake domains resembling legitimate websites while one is a legitimate 
domain nowadays. Le-progres.net could be easily confused with leprogres.fr, the official 
website of the Lyon news paper Le Progres. Usthb-dz.org is remarkably similar to 
usthb.dz, the website of the University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene in 
Algiers, Algeria.  

The third domain though, ghatreh.com, is the legitimate address of an Iranian news 
website. According to domaintools.com, this domain has been created in November 2004 
while the last change happened in September 2012. Also, domaintools.com reveals 14 
unique IP addresses and 4 different registrars. It is assumed that the domain has been 
dropped by the attackers in 2012 and picked up by legitimate operators.

page | 10

Illustration 5: The website of ghatreh.com today

The IP addresses of the domains in 2011, at a time when dropper, payload and C&Cs 
were still active, were 69.90.160.65, 70.38.107.13 and 70.38.12.10. All three IPs are 
located in Canada, two relate to Montréal, one to Oakville. The complete passive DNS 
history can be reviewed in appendix A.

The binary also contains the URL 'http://1.9.32.11/bunny/test.php?rec=nvista', but the 
purpose of it remains unclear. This IP address is never contacted by the malware.

<INJECTED>0</INJECTED>
<STARTDELAY>0</STARTDELAY>
<DIEDELAY>120</DIEDELAY>

The configuration provides three keys for encryption and decryption of data. The 
command_key is used to decrypt commands received from the C&C server, the 
storage_key is used to encrypt and decrypt data being stored to files on disk and the 
response_key will encrypt callbacks to the C&C server. All data exchanged with any of the 
C&C servers as well as data stored to a file on disk is encrypted with the according key.

Diedelay and startdelay are timeout settings, the exact use of the parameter injected is 

page | 11

unclear up to the time of writing. Command_file_path_and_prefix defines the name of the 
file which will holds C&C commands and Lua scripts at runtime. The malware performs 
C&C command parsing and Lua script execution with dedicated threads, of which every 
thread creates its own net.cap file, extending the name by a fixed digit namely 0, 1, 3 or 4. 

At runtime the malware adds additional configuration parameters, which are not assigned 
an obvious name like those retrieved from the resource section. The synonyms for all 
encrypted configuration values as they are stored in Windows registry are:

–
–
–
–
–

ClassID
ipsecID
ipsecISAKMP
ipsecData
ipsecDSA
ipsecSA
ike

isakmpID
isakmpKey
HMACSHA1
isakmpData

After the configuration is retrieved from the resource section the malware will create a 
subkey for every parameter under [HKLM|HKCU]\Software\Microsoft\IPSec. This key has 
initially been created by the dropper. The attributes are encrypted before being written to 
registry, and will be decrypted on the fly every time the malware requests a specific 
parameter.  

2.4 THE MULTI-THREADING MODEL
Suspect #4 comes with a solid multi-threading model, which seeks to assure fail-safe and 
high-performance execution. The malware runs a main thread, which manages four worker
threads and performs C&C command parsing and Lua script execution. The worker 
threads are dedicated to receive commands and scripts through different ways. Next to 
that, the main thread also runs sub threads to maintain log files the malware creates at 
during execution and to keep track of the overall system load the malware creates.

The threads are coordinated via named events, global flag variables, in some cases also 

page | 12

mutexes or semaphores are used. The main action of the malware is carried out in the 
main thread, which parses commands and executes Lua scripts, provided by the worker 
threads via command files.

The threading model is summarized in the following graphic. 

Illustration 6: Summary of the thread model

2.4.1 PERFORMANCE MONITORING

A dedicated thread is present for monitoring the CPU load the malware itself generates. 
Therefor the thread enumerates all threads from the current process and calculates their 
execution time. 

The user- and kernel land execution time is measured for every thread using the kernel32!
GetThreadTimes API; then aggregated, so the final value holds the overall CPU usage 
time of the malware process. The thread keeps track of the time passing between 
executions. If the malware's active execution time in percentage of this delta exceeds a 
configured threshold, the malware will suspend all threads of its process for at least 5s. 
The threshold is retrieved from configuration in Windows registry, and can be controlled by
the botmaster via the C&C command setcpulimit (see section 2.5).

This clearly is an attempt to keeping a low profile on the infected machine. By maintaining 
its own execution load the bot's compromised svchost.exe process will not catch attention 
on the process list.

page | 13

2.4.2 THE BACKFILE LAUNCHING THREAD

The backfile launching thread got its name from the named event 'backfilelaunching' which
is set to indicate that the dedicated thread has started. Also in a 1s-frequency the malware 
runs the backfile thread to push dump files to one of its remote servers. 

The files are named Perflib_Perfdat_dmpbX.dat, where X is an index number starting with 
0. The data written to the file are status messages including a time stamp, which are 
returned by command and Lua script execution. The data is encrypted using the 
response_key from the configuration.  

2.4.3 THE HEARER THREADS

The term 'hearer' can be found plenty of times in the binary, it is assumed that it is 
equivalent to 'listener' of some sort. All together suspect #4 manages 4 hearer threads 
including one command file per thread. The command file is named net.capX, where X is 
the index of the thread; 0, 1, 3 or 4. 

The hearer thread's purpose is to receive instructions from the remote servers and provide
them to the main thread. Such instructions are commands and/or one or more Lua scripts. 
Each hearer has a dedicated method to receive instructions which is either separately via 
HTTP from the server, aggregated through a downloaded data file or as tasks to be 
configured as scheduled tasks. The hearer threads dump the received instructions to their 
net.cap-files, from where the main thread's command parsing routine fetches and 
executes them. The data is encrypted with the storage_key before written to disk. 

HEARER 0

Generic hearer thread. Started, but not involved in command fetching and parsing.

HEARER 1

Hearer 1 receives commands and Lua scripts directly via HTTP from one of the C&C 
servers. These are encrypted with the storage_key and stored to net.cap1 in the malware's
working directory. Interestingly, the malware handles successful downloads with the HTTP 
status code 418. This code is not part of the original HTTP standard, but was introduced in
RFC2324, 1998's traditional IETF April Fool's joke. The textual representation of status 
418 is “I'm a teapot.”.

HEARER 2

Hearer 2 is responsible for managing the scheduled tasks, titled 'crontasks' by the 
malware. The tasks are stored in a file named perf.tmp, and when due for execution are 
copied to the according net.cap-file, net.cap2 in this case. From there the main thread can 

page | 14

fetch and execute them in its command parsing loop. Hearer 2 also creates a swap file 
named perf.tmp2, which helps in selectively editing the initial task file and in managing the 
task list. 

HEARER 3

Hearer 3 searches for a file named netdump.db in its local working directory. If found, the 
thread will read its content in chunks representing different commands and paste these to 
net.cap3. Again, the data is encrypted with the storage_key. No functionality could be 
found in the malware code to write to netdump.db, which leaves the conclusion that this 
file will be downloaded from a C&C server.

2.5 C&C COMMAND PARSING
After initializing and starting all four hearer threads the main thread enters a command 
parsing loop. For every hearer the main thread
invokes the command and script execution function.
Therefor data is read from the encrypted net.capX-
file, where X indicates the index of the hearer; 0, 1,
3 or 4. Once decrypted, this data is parsed to find
valid C&C commands and / or valid Lua scripts to
execute. More details on command and script
execution can be found in section 2.6.

Notable is that the command parsing and execution
happens in a serial fashion, while Lua script
execution is handed over to dedicated threads. Also,
no direct relation between C&C commands and Lua
script execution could be identified.

The most notable actions of the bot can be
summarized as follows:

• Downloads and executes Lua scripts to

instrument its own code

• Can install managed tasks (named 'crontask')

for its integrated engine

• Can maintain FTP connections
• Can send and receive files via HTTP
• Writes runtime information to local files

    Illustration 7: Linear command execution

• Encryption for local data and network communication

However, suspect #4 does accept a list of hard coded commands to be sent by the C&C 
server. These mainly serve the purpose of controlling operation of the bot on the infected 
machine, such as restarting threads or setting configuration parameters. The full list of 
C&C commands can be found below:

mainfrequency – Set a new timeout value for the command parsing loop.

getconfig – Get configuration from registry and push it to C&C.

ftpput – Push a file to an FTP server.

ftpget – Download and store a file from an FTP server.

sendfile – Send a local file to one of the C&Cs.

getfile – Download and store a file from one of the C&Cs.

uninstall – Set runtime flags to instruct main thread to terminate and delete related files.

restarthearer – Restart one of the hearer threads, clean its runtime files.

restart – Set runtime flag to instruct main thread to restart all threads.

cleanhearer – Clear all files related to an indicated hearer thread.

timeout – Configure a timeout value for HTTP connections.

waitfor – Set a timeout value for hearer 1.

updatedietime – Update the dietime value in registry.

crontaska – Add new task to perf.tmp for hearer 2 to execute.

crontaskr – Remove an entry in perf.tmp.

crontaskl – List tasks from perf.tmp, write to perf.tmp2 and send to C&C.

maxpostdata – Set a limit for data size to be sent to C&C via registry to limit data traffic.

seturl – Add an additional C&C server URL to configuration in registry.

stop – Set runtime flag to instruct main thread to shut down.

setcpulimit – Configure a limit in percent for CPU usage, stored in registry.

Every command execution function returns a status line, such as for example "ftp 

page | 16

command succeeded for: %s!\n". The initial command, the status line and a current time 
stamp are encrypted and sent back to the C&C server. Additionally, the same data is 
written to the Perflib_Perfdat_dmpbX.dat file which is regularly pushed to the C&C by the 
backfile thread.  

For hearer 1 and 3 the command parsing routine will additionally manage two continuous 
log files which are named Perflib_Perfdata41X.dat and  Perflib_Perfdata_42X.dat, where X
is the respective hearer thread's index. More specifically, command parsing will increment 
a global variable holding the total amount of executed commands and scripts. This 4-byte 
value is appended to Perflib_Perfdata41X.dat before and Perlfib_Perfdata42X.dat after 
command execution. These files survive restart or cleanup, so every time the malware 
boots it reads the current status from these logs and continues from the latest value. This 
mechanism helps the botmaster to keep track of the bots activity on an infected host and 
could also be helpful in trouble shooting.

2.6 LUA ENGINE INTEGRATION
Suspect #4 incorporates an interpreter for Lua 5.1, LuaSocket 2.0.2 and C/Invoke Lua 
bindings. Lua is a lightweight programming language designed as a scripting language 
which can be embedded into applications, providing a C API for doing so. C bindings are 
provided through C/Invoke and enable Lua scripts to perform callbacks to C/C++ code. 
This constellation can be found in many video game engines to provide polymorphic 
behavior in games. Engine and game play features are injected through Lua scripts, which
instrument the game engine code. 

The Lua interpreter is very small, compiled roughly 180kB, thus can easily be integrated in 
an application. The C/Invoke bindings enable Lua to be completely independent from the 
C/C++ application, so injected scripts can be pure Lua code. 

page | 17

Illustration 8: A small portion of Lua callback functions

A script, if delivered to one of the hearer threads, will be provided through the 
corresponding net.cap-file of the hearer along with a C&C command. If a script is included 
in the data read from the net.cap-file, this is indicated by the start sentinel '<$'. Likewise, 
the end of a script is indicated by '$>'. 

Illustration 9: Command and script execution go hand in hand

Command execution goes hand in hand with Lua script execution, thus is dependent of the
four hearer threads. The work flow for each hearer per execution loop in the main thread is
as follows:

• Read and decrypt content from according net.cap-file
• See if an entry of the C&C command list can be found in the decrypted data

page | 18

If so, execute the command

•
• Hand the data over to the Lua

interpreter thread

• See if a Lua script can be located,

•

•

searching for start and end
sentinel
If so, start Lua thread and execute
script
If more than one script can be
found start more Lua threads
recursively

Illustration 10: Command and script execution in detail

After starting the Lua thread requests a value from Windows registry named 'EnableLua' 
under SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System. This key name 
stands for enable limited user account. When set to zero this key effectively disables UAC 
(User Account Control). The malware only requests the key value but does not change it. 
The value is later used by a callback function named 'popenWin' to decide on a way how a
sub process should be started. Options are via WMIC using wmic.exe, Microsoft CScript 
engine using cscript.exe or directly via spawning a command line through cmd.exe.

However, spawning sub processes is not the only feature which comes with Lua. The Lua 
interpreter is a powerful code base which enables suspect #4 to change functionality on 
the fly, as different scripts are downloaded and executed. The scripts define the 
functionality as they perform callbacks to the C/C++ code in the malware binary. The  
potential of the Lua interpreter can be investigated on the project homepage [4].

Like command execution, Lua script execution also returns a status message which is 
extended by a time stamp and forwarded to one of the C&C servers, as well as written to 
the backfile log in Perflib_Perfdat_dmpbX.dat. Likewise, the Lua threads log their activity 
to Perflib_Perfdata_41X.dat/42X.dat.  

Due to the absence of C&C servers which hold the Lua scripts for the bot's Lua interpreter 
the true nature of this feature remains unclear.

3. EVIL BUNNY IN THE SPOTLIGHT

Throughout analysis and due to the help of Paul Rascagniéres a number of binaries which 
relate to EvilBunny were identified [7]: 
2a64d331964dbdec8141f16585f392ba
40E0F0681C79D70AC0329E68A94294CB
8132ee00f64856cf10930fd72505cebe
e8a333a726481a72b267ec6109939b0d
3bbb59afdf9bda4ffdc644d9d51c53e7
c40e3ee23cf95d992b7cd0b7c01b8599
330dc1a7f3930a2234e505ba11da0eea
83b7c532663f11bf994a1b518880557d
b8ac16701c3c15b103e61b5a317692bc
bbf4b1961ff0ce19db748616754da76e

The binaries share parts of source code, most notably is the identical API name 
obfuscation algorithm and respective key AB34CD77h. 

The indicators of a relation among all samples or a subset of samples are the following:

• Same API name obfuscation algorithm and key
• Equal infection routines / source code
• Equal AntiVirus product enumeration technique 
• Shared C&C domain names and equal C&C commands
• Equal proxy bypass technique / source code 

Mentioned set of malware also shows parallels in coding style and structure. However, it 
has to be pointed out that suspect #4 without doubt sticks out in terms of complexity and 
functionality. It is assumed that suspect #4 was created by the same authors, but this 
cannot be proved. 

Four of the set of identified samples are identical in functionality and capability. They 
possess respectable flooding capabilities and also provide remote access. However, they 
do not support data stealing or any spying functionality [8]. Two more C&C domains were 
identified for this group:

http://callientefever.info/img/new/n.php
http://fullapple.net/pictures/bkp/n.php  

Regarding the nature of the attack or the actor behind EvilBunny only vague conclusions 

page | 20

can be drawn. There has been public contemplation that the actor might be french and that
the malware might be related to samples analyzed by the Canadian CSEC [9]. However, 
there hasn't been any hard evidence which links the attack to a group or a geographical 
location. Attribution is a tricky task and assumptions must not be drawn easily.
