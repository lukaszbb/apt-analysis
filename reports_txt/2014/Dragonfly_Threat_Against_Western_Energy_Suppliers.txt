OVERVIEW

A cyberespionage campaign against a range of targets, mainly in the energy sector, gave 
attackers the ability to mount sabotage operations against their victims. The attackers, 
known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to compromise a number of strategically 
important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the sabotage capabilities 
open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to the energy supply in the affected 
countries.

The Dragonfly group, which is also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, are a capable 
group who are evolving over time and targeting primarily the energy sector and related 
industries. They have been in operation since at least 2011 but may have been active even 
longer than that. Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies in the US 
and Canada before shifting its focus to US and European energy firms in early 2013. More 
recent targets have included companies related to industrial control systems.  

Dragonfly has used spam email campaigns and watering hole attacks to infect targeted 
organizations. The group has used two main malware tools: Trojan.Karagany and 
Backdoor.Oldrea. The latter appears to be a custom piece of malware, either written by 
or for the attackers.

Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers

Timeline

 Figure 1. Timeline of Dragonfly operations

Symantec observed spear phishing attempts in the form of emails with PDF attachments from February 2013 
to June 2013. The email topics were related to office administration issues such as dealing with an account or 
problems with a delivery. Identified targets of this campaign were mainly US and UK organizations within the 
energy sector.

In May 2013, the attackers began to use the Lightsout exploit kit as an attack vector, redirecting targets from 
various websites. The use of the Lightsout exploit kit has continued to date, albeit intermittently. The exploit kit 
has been upgraded over time with obfuscation techniques. The updated version of Lightsout became known as 
the Hello exploit kit.

A newer approach used by the attackers involves compromising the update site for several industrial control 
system (ICS) software producers. They then bundle Backdoor.Oldrea with a legitimate update of the affected 
software. To date, three ICS software producers are known to have been compromised.

The Dragonfly attackers used hacked websites to host command-and-control (C&C) software. 
Compromised websites appear to consistently use some form of content management system. 

Victims

The current targets of the Dragonfly group, 
based on compromised websites and hijacked 
software updates, are the energy sector and 
industrial control systems, particularly those 
based in Europe. While the majority of victims 
are located in the US, these appear to mostly 
be collateral damage. That is, many of these 
computers were likely infected either through 
watering hole attacks or update hijacks and 
are of no interest to the attacker. 

By examining victims with active infections – 
where additional malicious activity has been 
detected – it is possible to gather a more 
accurate picture of ‘true’ victims.

The most active infections, as in Figure 2, are 

 Figure 2. Top 10 countries by active infection

in Spain, followed in order by the US, France, Italy, and Germany. 

Tools and tactics

Dragonfly uses two main pieces of malware in its attacks. Both are Remote Access Tool (RAT) type malware 
which provide the attackers with access and control of compromised computers. Dragonfly’s favored malware 
tool is Backdoor.Oldrea, which is also known as Havex or the Energetic Bear RAT. Oldrea acts as a back door for 
the attackers on to the victim’s computer, allowing them to extract data and install further malware. 

Oldrea appears to be custom malware, either written by the group itself or created for it. This provides some 
indication of the capabilities and resources behind the Dragonfly group. The second main tool used by Dragonfly 
is Trojan.Karagany. Unlike Oldrea, Karagany was available on the underground market. The source code for 
version 1 of Karagany was leaked in 2010. Symantec believes that Dragonfly may have taken this source code 
and modified for its own use.

Symantec found that the majority of computers compromised by the attackers were infected with Oldrea. 
Karagany was only used in around 5 percent of infections. The two pieces of malware are similar in functionality 
and what prompts the attackers to choose one tool over another remains unknown. 

Spam campaign

The Dragonfly group has 
used at least three infection 
tactics against targets in the 
energy sector. The earliest 
method was an email spear 
phishing campaign, which saw 
selected executives and senior 
employees in target companies 
receive emails containing a 
malicious PDF attachment. 
Infected emails had one of two 
subject lines: “The account” 
or “Settlement of delivery 
problem”. All of the emails were 
from a single Gmail address. 
Figure 3 displays the number of 
different recipients per day.

The spam campaign began in 
February 2013 and continued 
into June 2013. Symantec 
identified seven different 
organizations targeted in this 
campaign. At least one organization was attacked intermittently for a period of 84 days.

 Figure 3. Spam campaign activity from mid-February 2014 to mid-June 2013

Watering hole attacks

In June 2013, the attackers shifted their focus to watering hole attacks. They compromised a number of energy-
related websites and injected an iframe into each of them. This iframe then redirected visitors to another 
compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. This in turn exploited either Java or Internet 
Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer. The fact that the attackers compromised 
multiple legitimate websites for each stage of the operation is further evidence that the group has strong 
technical capabilities.

Page 6

Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers

In September 2013, 
Dragonfly began using 
a new version of this 
exploit kit, known as the 
Hello exploit kit. The 
landing page for this kit 
contains JavaScript which 
fingerprints the system, 
identifying installed 
browser plugins. The 
victim is then redirected 
to a URL which in turn 
determines the best 
exploit to use based on 
the information collected.

Figure 4 shows the 
compromised websites 
categorized into their 
respective industries. 
Fifty percent of identified 
targets were energy 
industry related and 
thirty percent were 
energy control systems, as shown in Figure 4. A clear shift in the attackers targeting can be seen in March 2014 
when energy control systems become the primary target. 

 Figure 4. Targeted industries over time

Trojanized software

The most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of a number of legitimate software 
packages. Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the software 
bundles they had made available for download on their websites.

Source time zone

Analysis of the compilation timestamps 
on the malware used by the attackers 
indicate that the group mostly worked 
between Monday and Friday, with activity 
mainly concentrated in a nine-hour period 
that corresponded to a  9am to 6pm 
working day in the UTC +4 time zone.

Conclusion

The Dragonfly group is technically adept and able to think strategically. Given the size of some of its targets, the 
group found a “soft underbelly” by compromising their suppliers, which are invariably smaller, less protected 
companies.

Appendix - Technical Description

Identification of this group is based on the use of two malware families and an exploit kit. The malware families 
utilized are Backdoor.Oldrea and Trojan.Karagany. The exploit kit is known as Lightsout and/or Hello. Hello is an 
updated iteration of Lightsout that the Dragonfly group began to use in September 2013.

Use of Backdoor.Oldrea appears to be limited to the Dragonfly group. In addition, specific instances of Trojan.
Karagany have been used by this group. Karagany is a Russian RAT sold on underground forums. Instances of 
this malware related to the Dragonfly group are identified based on them being delivered through the Lightsout 
exploit kit and also a particular packer that this group used. Symantec detects the Trojan.Karagany packer used 
by this group as Trojan.Karagany!gen1.

The Lightsout exploit kit is a simple exploit kit that is consistently used to deliver primarily Backdoor.Oldrea and, 
in several instances, Trojan.Karagany. 

Lightsout exploit kit

A number of sites that use content 
management systems were exploited and 
an iframe was used in order to redirect 
visitors to sites hosting the Lightsout 
exploit kit. 

An example of an injected iframe can be 
seen in figure 7.

The exploit kit uses browser (e.g. 
Internet Explorer and Firefox) and Java 
exploits in order to deliver either Backdoor.Oldrea or Trojan.Karagany.

In September 2013, the 
Dragonfly group began 
using a new version of 
Lightsout, also known 
as the Hello exploit kit. 
The JavaScript included 
in the landing page 
redirects the browser 
to a URL that depends 
on the fonts installed 
on the system, browser 
add-ons, the OS version, 
and the user agent. At 
this point, it determines 
the best exploit to 
use, based on the 
information provided, and generates an appropriate URL to redirect the user to the appropriate exploit/payload.

Backdoor.Oldrea

At the core of Backdoor.Oldrea is a persistent component that interacts with C&C servers to download and 
execute payloads. The components are downloaded by reaching out to the C&C server and performing a GET 
request which returns an HTML page containing a base64 encoded string between two comments marked with 
the ‘havex’ string.
Installation

File system modifications
•  %Temp%\qln.dbx
•  %System%\TMPprovider038.dll

Registry modifications

In this specific example, the ‘038’ in the file name indicates the major version number.
•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\”TmProvider”
•  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\”TmProvider”
•  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\InternetRegistry\”fertger”
•  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\InternetRegistry

Code injection
•  Backdoor.Oldrea injects code into explorer.exe.

Networking
Post infection, Backdoor.Oldrea will attempt to collect system information such as OS, user name, computer 
name, country, language, nation, Internet adapter configuration information, available drives, default browser, 
running processes, desktop file list, My Documents, Internet history, program files, and root of available drives. 
It also collects data from Outlook (address book) and ICS related software configuration files. This data is 
collected and written to a temporary file in an encrypted form before it is POST’ed to a remote C&C server. The 
following are examples of a POST request and a POST response:

Various samples process the C&C responses differently. 

In one example, the sample searches for the data enclosed by the tag ‘havex’. Once the data is found, it is 
decoded using standard base64 + bzip2 and also a xor layer with bytes from the string 1312312. The decoded 
data contains a small header followed by an executable MZ-file.

Another sample was found to use standard base64 + reverse xor + RSA-2048 for decrypting received data. The 
decrypted data consists of a 6 byte command concatenated with an MZ file. The MZ file is compressed with the 
lzma algorithm. RSA keys for decryption, together with other initial configuration information, are stored in the 
registry in base64 form.
Payloads
This section includes information about identified payloads downloaded by Backdoor.Oldrea.

The following is a brief description of the functionality for each identified component:
•  Tmpprovider is a persistent component that interacts with the C&C server (downloads and executes payloads).
•  The InstallerFormDll component usually embeds another executable (DLL) in its resource section to be 

loaded. The sample analyzed carried a Web browser password recovery tool originating from 
http://securityxploded.com/browser-password-decryptor.php

•  The RunExeCmdSingle component is a DLL file that drops and executes another executable. The export 

‘runDll’ of this file is where the logic is implemented.

•  DropCommandsCmd is a cleanup module, used to remove traces of itself from the infected computer.
•  The GetFileCmd modules check for the existence of specific files on the infected host. The two samples look 

for the ICS related software file and Outlook’s autocomplete address book file (outlook.nk2).

Trojan.Karagany

Trojan.Karagany is a back door used primarily for recon. It is designed to download and install additional files 
and exfiltrate data. Samples sometimes use common binary packers such as UPX and Aspack on top of a custom 
Delphi binary packer/protector for the payload. Where present in samples, the Delphi packer is configured to use 
‘neosphere’ as a key to decrypt the payload. 

The following is a brief overview of the functionality of Trojan.Karagany:
•  Can upload, download, and execute files on the system
•  Has plugin capability (may load several plugins for added functionality, such as Web injects)
•  Payload is approximately 72Kb in size and is programmed in C/C++
•  Contains a small embedded DLL file, which monitors WSASend and send APIs for capturing ‘Basic 

Authentication’ credentials

Installation
Trojan.Karagany creates a folder in the user APPDATA directory and chooses the directory name from the 
following list:
•  Microsoft WCF services
•  Broker services
•  Flash Utilities
•  Media Center Programs
•  Policy Definitions
•  Microsoft Web Tools
•  Reference Assemblies
•  Analysis Services
•  InstallShield Information
•  IIS SQL Server
•  Diagnostics
•  NTAPI Performance
•  WPF Platform
It copies itself in the created directory with hidden and system attributes using a file name chosen from the 
following list:
•  SearchIndexer.exe
•  ImeBroker.exe
•  fsutil.exe
•  PnPutil.exe
•  BdeUISrv.exe
•  WinSAT.exe
•  pwNative.exe
•  SnippingTool.exe
•  DFDWizard.exe
•  PrintBrmEngine.exe
•  WbemMonitor.exe
•  dxpserver.exe
•  PowerMng.exe

Page 13

Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers

Trojan.Karagany copies itself with hidden and system attributes where it was first executed as err.log[DIGITS]. It 
then copies the legitimate chkdsk utility in the installation folder using the payload file name but with a space before 
the file extension. This may fool ordinary users into thinking that this folder contains a legitimate application, for 
example PnPutil .exe. Trojan.Karagany!gen1 may create the following additional files in the installation folder:
•  Form.api
•  inact.api
•  prog.cer
•  Cent.api
•  ie.pdb
It then creates a C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\gl directory as a temporary directory used for uploading files.  
Trojan.Karagany then creates a link to itself in the Startup folder as an autostart when the system restarts.
Networking
Trojan.Karagany first checks for a live Internet connection by visiting Microsoft or Adobe websites. It will only reach 
out to its C&C server once this check is successful.
