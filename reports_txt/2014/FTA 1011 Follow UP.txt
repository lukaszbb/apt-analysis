Follow-Up #1 Fidelis Threat Advisory #1011 
Intruder File Report- Sneakernet Trojan 

 
 

January 31, 2014 

Document Status:  FINAL 

Last Revised:  2014-01-31 

 
 
 
 
Executive Summary 
Previous General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Services (Fidelis) reporting, ref: Fidelis Threat 
Advisory (FTA) #1011 dated 15 Jan 2014, introduced a malware system comprised of multiple 
files that provided a means for intruders to discover and retrieve data from disparate computer 
systems via removable storage devices. The malware system consists of at least two Portable 
Executable (PE) files, one acting as a headquarters component and one acting as field unit or 
agent component. The headquarters component infects drives connected to its host system with 
the field unit component and retrieves data from the field unit on the infected drive’s return to the 
headquarters host system. The field unit conducts reconnaissance and data collection in 
accordance with particular commands. 
Continuing analysis solidified the headquarters component’s Command and Control (C2) scheme. 
The malware receives commands from a locally stored encrypted file. 
This report describes select malware functionality with some granularity, provides extended detail 
regarding the headquarters component’s C2 functionality, provides additional means of defensive 
detection of this malware and describes some interesting aspects of the malware as a whole. 
The Fidelis team updated Fidelis XPSTM advanced threat defense system with additional rules to 
reflect current analysis findings associated with this malware.  
Forensic Analysis Findings 
Basic Functionality 
Previous reporting, ref: Fidelis Threat Advisory (FTA) #1011 dated 15 Jan 2014, introduced a 
malware system comprised of multiple files that reflected a means for intruders to discover and 
retrieve data from disparate computer systems via removable storage devices. Analysis of the 
system relied on the availability of two files named netsat.exe and netui3.dll. Netsat.exe 
functioned as a master application affording intruders the ability, in a selective and controlled 
manner, to infest removable devices with an agent application in the form of netui3.dll, aka

setup35.exe, aka update.exe. Previous reporting likened netsat.exe as a headquarters application 
and netui3.dll as a field unit with the following basic functionality: 

 

Headquarters (netsat.exe) 

•  Running on a possibly compromised system 
•  Logging some activity and errors to a file 
•  Receiving commands via an encrypted file on the local system (possible C2) 
•  Listening for drive connections 
Infecting connected drives with netui3.dll/winmgt.dll (setup35.exe + Autorun.inf) 
• 
•  Collecting data gathered by any infected drives, ostensibly upon their return from 

being connected to other systems 

Field Unit (netui3.dll) 

•  Collecting information about systems it comes into contact with through connection to 

the targeted systems with the drive whereon the malware resides 

•  Collecting file listings from local and share connected drives 
•  Discovering and connecting to shared drives visible to the local targeted system 
•  Copying and writing files to/from drives visible to the local targeted system 

The following graphic serves to illustrate a possible basic theory of operation given available 
data:

Continued analysis disclosed details regarding the field unit/agent application. The following 
reflects observations during field unit execution from an infected external drive: 
 

•  The malware attempts to ensure errors are suppressed and not observed by a user 
•  The malware performs specific environment checking to adapt to Windows versions 

from at least Windows 2000 to Windows7/Server 2008 and up 

•  The malware terminates if it detects another iteration of itself via the Mutex 

•  The malware terminates if any Gateway IPs associated with the resident system are 

“Mtx_Sp_on_PC_1_2_8” 

in the 10.x.x.x range 

•  The malware copies itself to 

<CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA>\Microsoft\Windows\Help\update.exe 

•  The malware runs update.exe with the parameters “-wu external drive letter”, e.g., z:, 

with the temporary directory specified for the working directory 

•  The malware copies a file named ~disk.ini from the infected drive to 

<CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA>\Microsoft\Windows\Help\intr 

•  The malware checks the system date against 31 May 2013; if on or after, the 

malware terminates 

•  The malware copies <CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA>\Microsoft\Windows\Help\intr to 

<CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA>\Microsoft\Windows\Chars\intr

Previous analysis results indicated netsat.exe retrieved commands from an encrypted file named 
netwn.drv resident in the CSIDL_WINDOWS\msagent\ directory. The encryption was a Tiny 
Encryption Algorithm (TEA) implementation that used a key that was modified during encryption 
and decryption operations.

Analysis efforts did not have access to ‘command’ files retrieved from the victim systems for 
either the headquarters or the field unit applications. However, using the malware’s behavior and 
determining the command file’s format via reverse engineering afforded the ability to test 
numerous  assumptions about the malware’s intended use. Analysis determined the command 
format was: drive identification followed by one or more command and parameter strings. The 
following table reflects testing and theoretical contents of command files driving netsat.exe 
operation:

Interesting	  Artifacts	  and	  Observations	  
Previous and continuing analysis results indicated some interesting and/or relevant 
aspects of this malware: 

•  The malware tries to be quiet - error handling 
•  There was robust implementation intention across Windows versions 
•  The malware employs robust environment checking; frustrating inadvertent 

execution and analysis 

•  The malware prevents multiple iterations of itself on individual systems 
•  The malware does not run on systems using Gateways assigned a particular 

internal net range (10.x.x.x) 

•  The malware’s execution has an expiration date 
•  The malware purposely obfuscates and complicates C2 
•  The malware injects complexity into C2 encryption operations; obfuscating 

execution and frustrating/delaying analysis 

•  The malware uses obscure file system paths 
•  The malware author, ironically or purposely, named a collected data storage 

folder ‘Intel’

The following interesting questions/assumptions emerged from previous cursory 
analysis of this malware: 

•  C2 appears to be accomplished via providing commands in an encrypted file 
stored on the local ‘master’ system (re: netsat.exe). This C2 scheme would 
seem to dictate: 

 Intruder remote access to the ‘master’ system 
Intruder local access to the ‘master’ system 

o 
o 
o  a C2 delivery/retrieval component, such as another piece of code that 

downloads a C2 file 

•  Available information precludes determination of the means of exfiltration. 

Netsat.exe’s data collection functionality suggested data destined for 
exfiltration might be collected by the ‘master’ system. This possibility 
suggests: 

Intruder remote access to the ‘master’ system 
Intruder local access to the ‘master’ system 

o 
o 
o  An exfiltration mechanism in the form of another piece of code 

 
Further analysis confirms the malware’s use of an encrypted file stored on the system 
whereon the malware is executing without an apparent means of automatic generation. 
This continues to suggest that intruders either have local or remote access to 
headquarters systems running netsat.exe or access to another application that 
automates remote C2 data/file retrieval. Intruders’ apparent ability to distinguish between 
particular field unit vehicles (infected drives), ref:  Possible	  Commands	  One	  -­‐	  Targeting	  Specific	  
Devices	  (Known	  to	  Intruder	  From	  Previous	  netsat/netui3	  Activity)	  from	  Hypothetical	  command	  table,	  
suggests active engagement with the malware and targets. 

Conclusion	  
This report is based on information extracted from reverse engineering and analysis of 
two PE files. There are other components and artifacts of this malware that are currently 
inaccessible to Fidelis analysts. Therefore, analysts extrapolated some of the behavior 
presented here. While analysts are confident about behaviors described to date, there 
could certainly be additional behaviors and nuances heretofore unseen. 
 
Analysis of this malware continues to suggest that a sophisticated effort was behind its 
creation and employment. Actors went to great lengths to make the malware efficient 
and effective while building in obfuscation and complexity. Interesting artifacts and 
observations continue to be discovered and made, such as the malware’s apparent 
expiration, the interesting naming convention for a directory to hold collected data, and 
the actors’ apparent intention to avoid certain networks or network addressing schemes.
