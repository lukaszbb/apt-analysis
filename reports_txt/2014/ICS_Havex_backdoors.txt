Full Disclosure of Havex Trojans

Monday, 27 October 2014 11:11:00 (UTC/GMT)

I did a presentation at the 4SICS conference earlier this week, where I disclosed the results from my
analysis of the Havex RAT/backdoor (slides available here).

The Havex backdoor is developed and used by a hacker group called Dragonfly, who are also known as
"Energetic Bear" and "Crouching Yeti". Dragonfly is an APT hacker group, who have been reported to
specifically target organizations in the energy sector as well as companies in other ICS sectors such as
industrial/machinery, manufacturing and pharmaceutical.

In my 4SICS talk I disclosed a previously unpublished comprehensive view of ICS software that has been
trojanized with the Havex backdoor, complete with screenshots, version numbers and checksums.

Dale Petersen, founder of Digital Bond, expressed the following request regarding the lack of public
information about the software trojanized with Havex:

If the names of the vendors that unwittingly spread Havex were made public, the wide coverage
would likely reach most of the affected asset owners.

Following Dale's request we decided to publish the information presented at 4SICS also in this blog post,
in order to reach as many affected asset owners as possible. The information published here is based on
our own sandbox executions of Havex malware samples, which we have obtained via CodeAndSec and
malwr.com. In addition to what I presented at 4SICS, this blog post also includes new findings published
by Joel "scadahacker" Langill in version 2.0 of his Dragonfly white paper, which was released just a couple
of hours after my talk.

In Symantec's blog post about Havex they write:

Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the
software bundles

Trojanized MESA Imaging driver

The first vendor known to have their software trojanized by the Dragonfly group was the Swiss company
MESA Imaging, who manufacture industrial grade cameras for range measurements.

eWON / Talk2M

The second vendor to have their software trojanized was the Belgian company eWON, who provide a
remote maintenance service for industrial control systems called “Talk2M”.

eWon published an incident report in January 2014 and then a follow-up report in July 2014 saying:

Back in January 2014, the eWON commercial web site www.ewon.biz had been compromised. A
corrupted eCatcherSetup.exe file had been uploaded into the CMS (Content Management
System) of www.ewon.biz web site. eCatcher download hyperlinks were rerouted to this
corrupted file. The corrupted eCatcherSetup.exe contained a malware which could, under

restricted conditions, compromise the Talk2M login of the infected user.

Prior to version 2.0 of Joel's Dragonfly report, eCatcher was the only product from eWON known to be
infected with the Havex backdoor. However, Joel's report also listed a product called “eGrabit”, which we
managed to obtain a malware sample for via malwr.com.

MB Connect Line

The most recent company known to have their software infected with the Havex backdoor was the German
company MB Connect Line GmbH, who are known for their industrial router mbNET and VPN service
mbCONNECT24.

MB Connect Line published a report about the Dragonfly intrusion in September 2014, where they write:

On 16th of April 2014 our website www.mbconnectline.com has been attacked by hackers. The
files mbCHECK (Europe), VCOM_LAN2 and mbCONFTOOL have been replaced with infected
files. These files were available from 16th of April 2014 to 23th of April 2014 for download from

our website. All of these files were infected with the known Trojan Virus Havex Rat.

Notice how only mbCHECK for users in Europe was trojanized, there has been no report of the USA/CAN
version of mbCHECK being infected with Havex.

We have not been able to get hold of a malware sample for the trojanized version of VCOM_LAN2. The
screenshot below is therefore from a clean version of this software.

Conclusions on Havex Trojans

The vendors who have gotten their software trojanized by Dragonfly are all European ICS companies
(Switzerland, Belgium and Germany). Additionally, only the mbCHECK version for users in Europe was
infected with Havex, but not the one for US / Canada. These facts indicate that the Dragonfly / Energetic
Bear threat actor seems to primarily target ICS companies in Europe.

Next: Detecting Havex with NSM

We're currently working on a follow-up blog post, which shows how to detect and analyze network traffic
from ICS networks infected with Havex.
