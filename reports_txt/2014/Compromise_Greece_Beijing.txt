#9 Blitzanalysis: Embassy of Greece Beijing - Compromise

It's friday afternoon, I had a bit of free time and stumbled across this tweet by PhysicalDrive0 (thx!) two
hours ago and thought to give it a try to finally add a new article to this Blog (first of 2014):

https://twitter.com/PhysicalDrive0/status/479921770838102017

So, I went to Google to search for the domain of the Embassy of Greece Beijing and added the (allegedly)
malicious java file package that was found by PhysicalDrive0:

URL: http://www.grpressbeijing.com/1.jar (malicious!)

Next, I loaded the 1.jar file into Java Decompiler to get the source code. It showed, that the functionality is
obfuscated in some way, e.g. the function csfn(String paramString) decrypts all strings by "removing" the
numbers of the string parameter:

csfn("64s33333e3333t333S55e666c777u5r333i534t76y2M34a55n76a88g666e44r2222") ->
setSecurityManager

There are some other obfuscation techniques, but they are not important here. Instead, the following
deobfuscated code line in the function init() gives us an idea where the actual payload is located:

Resp localResp = new Resp(csfn("234p34a55445c43654k632434234235")); -> pack

We can also see, that the java package contains a file named pack, so we open 7-Zip and unpack the file. A
quick view with a PE viewer showed, that it is a x86 PE executable not even encrypted (SHA256:
b832e4b5a4829c8df6de7b42c5cb32ef25b5ab59072b4c2a7838404cd0dd5e5f):

Figure 3: Payload inside PE viewer

So, I opened IDA Pro to take a quick look at the functionality. Together with the strings of the executable,
we get a brief idea of what the purpose of this malware is. The important strings are as follows:

SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"  /v PrivDiscUiShown /t
REG_DWORD /d  1  /f
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main"  /v DEPOff /t REG_DWORD /d  1  /f
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main"  /v DisableFirstRunCustomize /t

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\PhishingFilter"  /v ShownVerifyBalloon /t

2  /f
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Connection Wizard"  /v Completed /t REG_BINARY /d  1 
/f
\cmd.exe

Together with the output of IDA Pro, we can see that this malware uses the command line tool cmd.exe for
adding several registry keys to Internet Explorer. It also tries to retrieve possible AntiVirus information by
using the COM interface (dc12a687-737f-11cf-884d-00aa004b2e24 -> IWbemLocator -> SELECT *
FROM AntiVirusProduct). Furthermore, it makes use of the COM to launch an instance of Internet
Explorer (d30c1661-cdaf-11d0-8a3e-00c04fc9e26e -> IWebBrowser2), supposedly to contact its C&C
server. To verify this, we open up Wireshark and run the executable. As a result, we get the following
network information:

C&C server: defense.miraclecz.com (IP: 208.115.124.83)
HTTP GET request: /index.asp?id=50100

Also, we see that it downloads some kind of data (Base64 encoded). But first, we combine the C&C server
and the HTTP request and open the URL in our favorite Browser:

URL: defense.miraclecz.com/index.asp?id=50100

Figure 4: Base64 encoded (2nd) Payload

As you can see, there is a string named microsoft followed by Base64 encoded data. Side note: Is there
also a Linux equivalent?

Next, we copy the Base64 encoded data and go to the following website to let us decode it into a file
(because I had the feeling it's just another unencrypted executable):

http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp

As a result, we get another executable (SHA256:
a4863f44f48d1c4c050dd7baad767a86b348dd4d33924acf4e0a3cd40c6ae29f) that was only Base64
encoded and not encrypted in any way:

So again, we fire up our PE viewer and take a look at the important strings:

%s/?id1=%d%d

Again, we load the executable into IDA Pro and quickly fly over the assembly code to get an idea of the
functionality. Once again, it creates several registry entries with the help of the command line tool and
creates an instance of the Internet Explorer (CoCreateInstance() -> d30c1661-cdaf-11d0-8a3e-
00c04fc9e26e) for contacting the C&C server. This time, the network information is as follows:

C&C server: buy.miraclecz.com (IP: 74.121.191.33)
URL parameters (from strings of executable):
%s/?id1=blank%d&id2=%d%d
%s/?id1=%d%d

From the code we can see, that the sample has also the ability to encode/decode data from/to Base64. The
dynamic analysis showed the malware sample contacted the C&C server, but wasn't sending any URL
parameters (id1, id2). Also the server didn't respond...

That's it, have a nice weekend...
