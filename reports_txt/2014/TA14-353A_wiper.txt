Alert (TA14-353A)
Targeted Destructive Malware
Original release date: December 19, 2014

Systems Affected

Microsoft Windows
Overview

US-CERT was recently notified by a trusted third party of cyber threat actors using a Server Message Block (SMB) Worm Tool to conduct cyber exploitation
activities recently targeting a major entertainment company. This SMB Worm Tool is equipped with a Listening Implant, Lightweight Backdoor, Proxy Tool,
Destructive Hard Drive Tool, and Destructive Target Cleaning Tool.

SMB Worm Tool: This worm uses a brute force authentication attack to propagate via Windows SMB shares. It connects home every five minutes to send log data
back to command and control (C2) infrastructure if it has successfully spread to other Windows hosts via SMB port 445. The tool also accepts new scan tasking
when it connects to C2. There are two main threads: the first thread calls home and sends back logs (a list of successful SMB exploitations), and the second thread
attempts to guess passwords for SMB connections. If the password is correctly guessed, a file share is established and file is copied and run on the newly-infected
host.

Listening Implant: During installation of this tool, a portion of the binaries is decrypted using AES, with a key derived from the phrase "National Football League."
Additionally, this implant listens for connections on TCP port 195 (for "sensvc.exe" and "msensvc.exe") and TCP port 444 (for "netcfg.dll"). Each message sent to
and from this implant is preceded with its length, then XOR encoded with the byte 0x1F. Upon initial connection, the victim sends the string, "HTTP/1.1 GET /dns?
\x00." The controller then responds with the string "200 www.yahoo.com!\x00" (for "sensvc.exe" and "msensvc.exe") or with the string "RESPONSE 200 OK!!" (for
"netcfg.dll"). The controller sends the byte "!" (0x21) to end the network connection. This special message is not preceded with a length or XOR encoded.

Lightweight Backdoor: This is a backdoor listener that is designed as a service DLL. It includes functionality such as file transfer, system survey, process
manipulation, file time matching and proxy capability. The listener can also perform arbitrary code execution and execute commands on the command line. This
tool includes functionality to open ports in a victim host's firewall and take advantage of universal Plug and Play (UPNP) mechanisms to discover routers and
gateway devices, and add port mappings, allowing inbound connections to victim hosts on Network Address Translated (NAT) private networks. There are no
callback domains associated with this malware since connections are inbound only on a specified port number.

Proxy Tool: Implants in this malware family are typically loaded via a dropper installed as a service, then configured to listen on TCP port 443. The implant may
have an associated configuration file which can contain a configurable port. This proxy tool has basic backdoor functionality, including the ability to fingerprint the
victim machine, run remote commands, perform directory listings, perform process listings, and transfer files.

Destructive Hard Drive Tool: This tool is a tailored hard-drive wiping tool that is intended to destroy data past the point of recovery and to complicate the victim
machine’s recovery. If the CNE operator has administrator-level privileges on the host, the program will over-write portions of up-to the first four physical drives
attached, and over-write the master boot record (MBR) with a program designed to cause further damage if the hard drive is re-booted. This further results in the
victim machine being non-operational with irrecoverable data (There is a caveat for machines installed with the windows 7 operating system: windows 7 machines
will continue to operate in a degraded state with the targeted files destroyed until after reboot, in which the infected MBR then wipes the drive.) If the actor has
user-level access, the result includes specific files being deleted and practically irrecoverable, but the victim machine would remain usable.

Destructive Target Cleaning Tool: This tool renders victim machines inoperable by overwriting the Master Boot Record. The tool is dropped and installed by another
executable and consists of three parts: an executable and a dll which contain the destructive components, and an encoded command file that contains the actual
destruction commands to be executed.

Network Propagation Wiper: The malware has the ability to propagate throughout the target network via built-in Windows shares. Based on the
username/password provided in the configuration file and the hostname/IP address of target systems, the malware will access remote network shares in order to
upload a copy of the wiper and begin the wiping process on these remote systems. The malware uses several methods to access shares on the remote systems to
begin wiping files. Checking for existing shares via “\\hostname\admin$\system32” and “\\hostname\shared$\system32” or create a new share “cmd.exe /q /c net
share shared$=%SystemRoot% /GRANT:everyone, FULL”. Once successful, the malware uploads a copy of the wiper file “taskhostXX.exe”, changes the file-time
to match that of the built-in file “calc.exe”, and starts the remote process. The remote process is started via the command “cmd.exe /c wmic.exe /node:hostname
/user:username /password:pass PROCESS CALL CREATE”. Hostname, username, and password are then obtained from the configuration file. Afterwards, the
remote network share is removed via “cmd.exe /q /c net share shared$ /delete”. Once the wiper has been uploaded, the malware reports its status back to one of
the four C2 IP addresses.

Technical and strategic mitigation recommendations are included in the Solution section below.

US-CERT recommends reviewing the Security Tip Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003.
Description

Cyber threat actors are using an SMB worm to conduct cyber exploitation activities.  This tool contains five components – a listening implant, lightweight backdoor,
proxy tool, destructive hard drive tool, and destructive target cleaning tool.

The SMB worm propagates throughout an infected network via brute-force authentication attacks, and connects to a C2 infrastructure.
Impact

Due to the highly destructive functionality of this malware, an organization infected could experience operational impacts including loss of intellectual property and
disruption of critical systems.
Solution

Users and administrators are recommended to take the following preventive measures to protect their computer networks:

Use and maintain anti-virus software – Anti-virus software recognizes and protects your computer against most known viruses. It is important to keep your
anti-virus software up-to-date (see Understanding Anti-Virus Software for more information).
Keep your operating system and application software up-to-date – Install software patches so that attackers can't take advantage of known problems or
vulnerabilities. Many operating systems offer automatic updates. If this option is available, you should enable it (see Understanding Patches for more
information).
Review Security Tip Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003 and evaluate their capabilities encompassing planning, preparation, detection, and response
for such an event.
Review Recommended Practices for Control Systems, and Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies (pdf).

The following is a list of the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that can be added to network security solutions to determine whether they are present on a network.

The malware has the following characteristics:

While the original filename of this file is unknown, it was likely “diskpartmg16.exe”. This file serves as a dropper. It drops destructive malware: “igfxtrayex.exe”.
When the dropper file was executed, it started a second instance of itself with “-i” as an argument, and then terminated. The second instance of the dropper file
installed itself as the “WinsSchMgmt” service with “-k” as a command line argument, started the service, and then terminated. The “WinsSchMgmt” service
executed the file with “-k” as an argument, which started another instance of the file using “-s” as an argument. The “-s” instance dropped and executed
“igfxtrayex.exe”, created “net_ver.dat”, and began generating network traffic over TCP ports 445 and 139 to victim IP addresses.

This is a log file created by the dropper, and appended to as the scans progress  It contains what appear to be hostnames, IP addresses, and the number 2.  
Entries in the file have the structure “HOSTNAME | IP Address | 2”.

This file is destructive malware: a disk wiper with network beacon capabilities. If “igfxtrayex.exe” is run with no parameters, it creates and starts a copy of itself with
the “–i” argument. After 10 minutes, the “igfxtrayex.exe” makes three copies of itself and places them in the same directory from which it was executed. These
copies are named according to the format “taskhostXX.exe” (where X is a randomly generated ASCII character). These copies are then executed, each with a
different argument (one being “-m”, one being “-d” and the other “-w”). Network connection attempts are made to one of three hard-coded IP addresses in a random
order to port 8080 or 8000. If a connection to the IP address cannot be made, it attempts to connect to another of the three IP addresses, until connections to all
three IP addresses have been attempted. The following command-line string is then executed: “cmd.exe /c net stop MSExchangeIS /y”. A 120-minute (2 hour)
sleep command is issued after which the computer is shut down and rebooted.

Recommended Security Practices

Because of the highly destructive functionality of the malware, an organization infected with the malware could experience operational impacts including loss of
intellectual property (IP) and disruption of critical systems. Actual impact to organizations may vary depending on the type and number of systems impacted.

Tactical Mitigations

Implement the indicators of compromise within your systems for detection and mitigation purposes.

Encourage users to transfer critical files to network shares, to allow for central backed up.

Execute daily backups of all critical systems.

Periodically execute an “offline” backup of critical files to removable media.

Establish emergency communications plans should network resources become unavailable.

Isolate any critical networks (including operations networks) from business systems.

Identify critical systems and evaluate the need for having on-hand spares to quickly restore service.

Ensure antivirus is up to date.

Disable credential caching for all desktop devices with particular importance on critical systems such as servers and restrict the number of cached credential
for all portable devices to no more than three if possible. This can be accomplished through a Group Policy Object (GPO).

Disable AutoRun and Autoplay for any removable media device.

Prevent or limit the use of all removable media devices on systems to limit the spread or introduction of malicious software and possible exfiltration data,
except where there is a valid business case for use. This business case must be approved by the organization Chief IT Security Officer, with policy/guidance
on how such media should be used.

Consider restricting account privileges. It is our recommendation that all daily operations should be executed using standard user accounts unless
administrative privileges are required for that specific function. Configure all standard user accounts to prevent the execution and installation of any unknown
or unauthorized software. Both standard and administrative accounts should have access only to services required for nominal daily duties, enforcing the
concept of separation of duties. Lastly, disable Web and email capabilities on administrative accounts. Compromise of admin accounts is one vector that
allows malicious activity to become truly persistent in a network environment.

Ensure that password policy rules are enforced and Admin password values are changed periodically.

Consider prohibiting hosts within the production environment or DMZ from sharing an Active Directory enterprise with hosts on other networks. Each
environment should have separate forests within Active Directory, with no trust relationships allowed between the forests if at all possible. If necessary, the
trust relationships should be one-way with the low integrity environment trusting the higher integrity environment.

Consider deployment of a coaching page with click through acceptance; these are traditionally deployed in an environment to log the acceptance of network
acceptable use policy or to notify users of monitoring. Coaching pages also provide some measure of protection from automated malicious activity. This
occurs because automated malware is normally incapable of physically clicking an acceptance radial button. Automated malware is traditionally hardcoded to
execute, then retrieve commands or additional executables from the Internet. If the malware is unable to initiate an active connection, the full train of infection
is potentially halted. The danger still exists that the physical user will authorize access, but through the use of coaching pages, infections can be limited or at
least the rate of infection reduced.

Monitor logs -- Maintain and actively monitor a centralized logging solution that keeps track of all anomalous and potentially malicious activity.

Ensure that all network operating systems, web browsers, and other related network hardware and software remain updated with all current patches and
fixes.

Strategic Mitigations

Organizations should review Security Tip Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003 and evaluate their capabilities encompassing planning, preparation,
detection, and response for such an event.

Always keep your patch levels up to date, especially on computers that host public services accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and
DNS services.

Build host systems, especially critical systems such as servers, with only essential applications and components required to perform the intended function.
Any unused applications or functions should be removed or disabled, if possible, to limit the attack surface of the host.

Implement network segmentation through V-LANs to limit the spread of malware.

Consider the deployment of Software Restriction Policy set to only allow the execution of approved software (application whitelisting)

Recommend the whitelisting of legitimate executable directories to prevent the execution of potentially malicious binaries.

Consider the use of two-factor authentication methods for accessing privileged root level accounts or systems.

Consider deploying a two-factor authentication through a hardened IPsec/VPN gateway with split-tunneling prohibited for secure remote access.

Deny direct Internet access, except through the use of proxies for Enterprise servers and workstations. Perform regular content filtering at the proxies or
external firewall points of presence. Also consider the deployment of an explicit versus transparent proxy policy.

Implement a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) inspection capability to inspect both ingress and egress encrypted network traffic for potential malicious activity.

Isolate network services, such as email and Web application servers by utilizing a secure multi-tenant virtualization technology. This will limit the damage
sustained from a compromise or attack of a single network component.

Implement best practice guidance and policy to restrict the use of non-Foundation assets for processing or accessing Foundation-controlled data or systems
(e.g., working from home, or using a personal device while at the office). It is difficult to enforce corporate policies, detect intrusions, and conduct forensic
analysis or remediate compromises on non-corporate owned devices.

Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet.
