Introduction

During the 2014 Israel–Gaza con�ict, dubbed by Israel as
“operation protective edge”, a raise in cyber-attacks against Israeli
targets was reported. In this report we analyze one case of an
operation protective edge themed spear phishing attack. That
email contained a malicious excel �le, which once opened and its
VBA code executed, would infect the victim’s computer.

As for the publication of this report, the �le is recognized as
malicious by only one antivirus engine.

Based on our analysis, we believe the threat actor behind this
malware is a high level professional.

Gholee
Our investigation of the Gholee malware started following a
detection of a suspicious �le that was sent in an email to an
undisclosed recipient. The �le name was ‘Operation Protective
Edge.xlsb’ (MD5: d0c3f4c9896d41a7c42737134ffb4c2e).

The �le was uploaded to Virus Total the �rst time on 10 August
2014, from Israel. At that time it was not detected as malicious by
any of the 52 tested antivirus engines. Nine days later, it was

uploaded again to Virus total, again from Israel. This time it was
detected as malicious only by Kaspersky, as Trojan-
Dropper.MSExcel.Agent.ce.

Infection
Upon opening the �le a message is displayed, saying:

“Due to security considerations I consciously hid the
Informations. It will be visible for you by enabling content above.”

[1]

This is a social engineering tactic meant to lure the victim into
enabling Macro content. If enabled, the message disappears, and
the following information is presented to the victim (it is possible
that the unreadable characters in the screenshot below are the
result of an encoding error in our lab environment, and that the
victim would see different, readable content).

Technical Analysis
Analysis of the Macro code reveals the following structure:

In order to avoid detection by protection measures such as
computer antivirus and intrusion detection systems, ASCII

characters codes are used instead of actual characters. The ASCII
codes are converted to strings as they are concatenated into a
single variable within a function

Tens of these functions then concatenated, creating a single PE
�le

[3]

Finally, the �le is saved to NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll (MD5:
48573a150562c57742230583456b4c02) and the function
ShellExecte  is used to run it under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32  This
is in order to hide the process.

The Dll �le is obfuscated and includes various mechanism to hide
from Debuggers such as Ollydbg and IDA and from Sandbox
software such as Cuckoo and Anubis.

Analyzing the �le, we have found an interesting entry point called
gholee.

A quick Facebook search for that name and Iran discovered Gholee

Communication

When run, the DLL �le is communicating with a Kuwait based IP
address: 83.170.33.60, owned by German company iABG Mbh,
which provides satellite communication services.

The malware opens an SSL connection over port 443 using a
digital certi�cate that expired in 2010. The certi�cate was issued
for security company Core Security, the creators of the offensive
suite Core Impact, for the address *coreimpactagent.net.

It was issued by Thawte certi�cate authority.

Using a proxy and SSL stripping, the following communication
pattern over HTTP can be seen:

GET                        /index.php?c=Ud7atknq&r=17117d        HTTP/1.1

POST                     /index.php?c=Ud7atknq&r=1710b2        HTTP/1.1

Related incidents
Searching for speci�c strings from the malicious �le, we found
another �le that we believe is related to this campaign. The �le
name is “svchost 67.exe” (MD5:
916be1b609ed3dc80e5039a1d8102e82 ) and it was uploaded to
Virus Total[5] on 2 June 2014, more than two months earlier than
“Operation Protective Edge.xlsb”. It was uploaded twice from
Latvia – potentially to test the malware’s detection rate.

“svchost 67.exe” communicated with 83.170.33.37, which is on the
same /26 netblock as the address “Operation Protective Edge.xlsb”

Detection and prevention

By using GPO to disable macro code from running, infection by
this malware may be avoided.  Alternatively, �les containing
macro code should be blocked at the email gateway or by an
anti-spam solution.
Logs and proxy servers should be checked for communication
with the IP addresses with which the malware communicates:

83.170.33.60

83.170.33.37

If you think you got infected, check in the system root folder
for a �le called NTUSER.DAT.{$GUID}.dll . for example:

NTUSER.DAT{016888bd-6c6f-11de-8d1d-001e0b**c}.dll

The following Yara rule may be used to detect the gholee
malware:

rule gholee

meta:

author = “www.clearskysec.com”

date = “2014/08″
