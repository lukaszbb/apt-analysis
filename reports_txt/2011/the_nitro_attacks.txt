The Nitro Attacks
Stealing Secrets from the 
Chemical Industry

Eric Chien and 
Gavin O’Gorman

Introduction
This document discusses a recent targeted attack campaign directed 
primarily  at  private  companies  involved  in  the  research,  develop-
ment,  and  manufacture  of  chemicals  and  advanced  materials.  The 
goal  of  the  attackers  appears  to  be  to  collect  intellectual  property 
such  as  design  documents,  formulas,  and  manufacturing  processes. 
In  addition,  the  same  attackers  appear  to  have  a  lengthy  operation 
history  including  attacks  on  other  industries  and  organizations.  At-
tacks  on  the  chemical  industry  are  merely  their  latest  attack  wave. 
As  part  of  our  investigations,  we  were  also  able  to  identify  and  con-
tact  one  of  the  attackers  to  try  and  gain  insights  into  the  motiva-
tions  behind  these  attacks.  As  the  pattern  of  chemical  industry  tar-
gets  emerged,  we  internally  code-named  the  attack  campaign  Nitro. 

The  attack  wave  started  in  late  July  2011  and  continued  into  mid-
September  2011.  However,  artifacts  of  the  attack  wave  such 
as  Command  and  Control  (C&C)  servers  are  also  used  as  early 
as  April  2011  and  against  targets  outside  the  chemical  indus-
try.  The  purpose  of  the  attacks  appears  to  be  industrial  espio-
nage,  collecting  intellectual  property  for  competitive  advantage.  

Targets
The attackers have changed their targets over time. From late April to 
early May, the attackers focused on human rights related NGOs. They 
then moved on to the motor industry in late May. From June until mid-
July no activity was detected. At this point, the current attack campaign 
against the chemical industry began. This particular attack has lasted 
much longer than previous attacks, spanning two and a half months.

The Nitro Attacks: Stealing Secrets from the Chemical Industry

A total of 29 companies in the chemical sector were confirmed to be targeted in this attack wave and another 19 
in various other sectors, primarily the defense sector, were seen to be affected as well. These 48 companies are 
the minimum number of companies targeted and likely other companies were also targeted. In a recent two week 
period, 101 unique IP addresses contacted a command and control server with traffic consistent with an infected 
machine.  These IPs represented 52 different unique Internet Service Providers or organizations in 20 countries.

Companies affected include:
•	

Multiple Fortune 100 companies involved in research and development of chemical compounds and advanced 
materials.
Companies that develop advanced materials primarily for military vehicles.
Companies involved in developing manufacturing infrastructure for the chemical and advanced materials 
industry.

Attack methodology

The attackers first researched desired targets and then sent an email specifically to the target. Each organiza-
tion typically only saw a handful of employees at the receiving end of these emails. However, in one organization 
almost 500 recipients received a mail, while in two other organizations, more than 100 were selected. While 
the attackers used different pretexts when sending these malicious emails, two methodologies stood out. First, 
when a specific recipient was targeted, the mails often purported to be meeting invitations from established 
business partners. Secondly, when the emails were being sent to a broad set of recipients, the mails purported 
to be a necessary security update. The emails then contained an attachment that was either an executable that 
appeared to be a text file based on the file name and icon, or a password-protected archive containing an execut-
able file with the password provided in the email. In both cases, the executable file was a self-extracting execut-
able containing PoisonIvy, a common backdoor Trojan developed by a Chinese speaker.

When the recipient attempted to open the attachment, they would inadvertently execute the file, causing Poi-
sonIvy to be installed.  Once PoisonIvy was installed, it contacted a C&C server on TCP port 80 using an encrypt-
ed communication protocol. Using the C&C server, the attackers then instructed the compromised computer to 
provide the infected computer’s IP address, the names of all other computers in the workgroup or domain, and 
dumps of Windows cached password hashes.

By using access to additional computers through the currently logged on user or cracked passwords through 
dumped hashes, the attackers then began traversing the network infecting additional computers. Typically, their 
primary goal is to obtain domain administrator credentials and/or gain access to a system storing intellectual 
property. Domain administrator credentials make it easier for the attacker to find servers hosting the desired 
intellectual property and gain access to the sensitive materials. The attackers may have also downloaded and 
installed additional tools to penetrate the network further.

While the behavior of the attackers differs slightly in each compromise, generally once the attackers have identi-
fied the desired intellectual property, they copy the content to archives on internal systems they use as internal 
staging servers. This content is then uploaded to a remote site outside of the compromised organization com-
pleting the attack.

Geographic location of infected computers

Geographic Spread 
Figure 1 shows the location 
of infected computers. This 
data is derived from the 
IP addresses of machines 
connecting back to the 
command and control serv-
er. The majority of infected 
machines are located in 
the US, Bangladesh and 
the UK; however, overall 
there is wide geographical 
spread of infections.

Figure 2 shows the country 
of origin of the organiza-
tions targeted by these at-
tacks. While the US and UK 
again figure highly here, 
overall the geographical 
spread is different. This 
means that the infected 
computers are rarely 
located within the organi-
zations’ headquarters or 
country of origin.

*Additional confirmed infections exist; however, they did not contact  
the command and control server during the two-week period we were  
monitoring it.

There are two possible explanations for this:
•	

The attackers are targeting sites, or individuals in certain sites, which they know have access to certain data 
that is of interest to the attacker.
The attackers are targeting sites or individuals that they believe have less security measures in place and are 
therefore an easier access point into the victims’ networks.

•	

We can conclude that the attackers are not targeting organizations in a particular country.

Attribution

The attacks were traced back to a computer system that was a virtual private server (VPS) located in the United 
States. However, the system was owned by a 20-something male located in the Hebei region in China. We inter-
nally have given him the pseudonym of Covert Grove based on a literal translation of his name.  He attended a 
vocational school for a short period of time specializing in network security and has limited work experience, 
most recently maintaining multiple network domains of the vocational school.

Covert Grove claimed to have the U.S.-based VPS for the sole purpose of using the VPS to log into the QQ instant 
message system, a popular instant messaging system in China. By owning a VPS, he would have a static IP ad-
dress. He claims this was the sole purpose of the VPS. And by having a static IP address, he could use a feature 
provided by QQ to restrict login access to particular IP addresses. The VPS cost was RMB200 (US$32) a month. 
While possible, with an expense of RMB200 a month for such protection and the usage of a US-based VPS, the 
scenario seems suspicious. We were unable to recover any evidence the VPS was used by any other authorized 
or unauthorized users. Further, when prompted regarding hacking skills, Covert Grove immediately provided a 
contact that would perform ‘hacking for hire’. Whether this contact is merely an alias or a different individual has 
not been determined.

We are unable to determine if Covert Grove is the sole attacker or if he has a direct or only indirect role.  Nor are 
we able to definitively determine if he is hacking these targets on behalf of another party or multiple parties.

Technical details

As mentioned above, the threat used to compromise the targeted networks is Poison Ivy, a Remote Access Tool 
(RAT). This application is freely available from poisonivy-rat.com. It comes fully loaded with a number of plug-ins 
to give an attacker complete control of the compromised computer. 

Delivery

The method of delivery has changed over time as the attackers have changed targets. Older attacks involved a 
self-extracting archive with a suggestive name, for example: “Human right report of north Africa under the war.
scr”. The most recent attacks focusing on the chemical industry are using password-protected 7zip files which, 
when extracted, contain a self-extracting executable. The password to extract the 7zip file is included in the 
email. This extra stage is used to prevent automated systems from extracting the self-extracting archive. Some 
example file names using this technique include:
•

Malicious email

An example of an email used to send 
the attachment can be seen in figure 
3.

The email is quite generic, appli-
cable to any corporate user.  Some 
of the subject lines will vary and may 
include the name of the targeted 
company in an attempt to be more 
convincing. 

Threat details

%Temp%\happiness.txt
%Temp%\xxxx.exe

When the self-extracting archive file 
is executed, it will drop two files.  
Examples of file names that are used 
include: 
•	
•	
The executable file, xxxx.exe in this 
case, is then executed. The second 
file, happiness.txt, contains custom 
code in binary format that is en-
crypted and used by xxxx.exe.  The 
xxxx.exe file copies happiness.txt to 
C:\PROGRAM FILES\common files\
ODBC\ODUBC.DLL and to C:\WIN-
DOWS\system32\jql.sys. It then loads 
the contents of the encrypted file and 
injects it into the explorer.exe and 
iexplore.exe processes.

The injected code copies xxxx.exe to 
%System%\winsys.exe and connects 
to the Command and Control (C&C) server on TCP port 80.

The communication with the server is a handshake using an encryption algorithm (Camellia). Once the Trojan 
establishes the server’s authenticity, it expects a variable-size block of binary code that is read from the server 
straight into the virtual space for iexplore.exe and then executed.

When an executable is compiled, the compiler will store some metadata in the compiled executable. One particu-
lar piece of relevant metadata is the location of the compiled code on disk. The path in this instance contained 
Chinese characters and was:

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\桌面\新建文件夹\读取文件\Release\读取文件.pdb

This translates to:

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\[Desktop]\[New Folder]\[read the file]\Release\[read the file].pdb

Command and Control (C&C)

When executed, the Poison Ivy threat, or Backdoor.Odivy, connects to a command and control (C&C) server over 
TCP port 80. A number of different C&C domains and IP addresses were identified.  The domains and IPs are 
listed in table 1.

The majority of samples connect to 
a domain; however one subset of 
samples connected directly to the IP 
address 204.74.215.58, which be-
longed to the Chinese QQ user men-
tioned previously and was also associ-
ated with antivirus-groups.com.

Several other hacker groups have also 
begun targeting some of the same 
chemical companies in this time pe-
riod. Attackers are sending malicious PDF and DOC files, which use exploits to drop variants of Backdoor.Sogu. 
This particular threat was also used by hackers to compromise a Korean social network site to steal records of 35 
million users. 

173.252.205.36, 173.252.205.37, 173.252.205.64

anti-virus.sytes.net

Determining if the two groups are related is difficult, but any relationship appears unlikely. The attackers 
described in this document use a very basic delivery platform; compressed self-extracting archives sometimes 
sent to a large number of recipients. The Sogu gang, in contrast, use PDF and DOC files in very tailored, targeted 
emails. The Sogu gang use a custom developed threat – Backdoor.Sogu, whereas the group described in this 
document use an off the shelf threat – Poison Ivy.  While the number of Sogu targets is currently small relative to 
the Poison Ivy attacks, we continue to monitor their activities.

Summary

Numerous targeted attack campaigns are occurring every week.  However, relative to the total number of at-
tacks, few are fully disclosed.  These attacks are primarily targeting private industry in search of key intellectual 
property for competitive advantage, military institutions, and governmental organizations often in search of 
documents related to current political events and human rights organizations.

This attack campaign focused on the chemical sector with the goal of obtaining sensitive documents such as pro-
prietary designs, formulas, and manufacturing processes.
