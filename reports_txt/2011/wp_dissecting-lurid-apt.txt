ABSTRACT

This report investigates a campaign of targeted malware attacks that has successfully 
compromised 1465 computers in 61 different countries. Based on the project path 
embedded in the malware, we have named this speciﬁ c campaign “Lurid Downloader” 
although the malware is typically known as “Enfal”.  The majority of the victims are 
located in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS). We were able to identify 47 victims that include numerous government ministries 
and diplomatic missions along with space-related government agencies, companies 
and research institutions in Russia and other members of the CIS along with a smaller 
amount of similar entities in Europe. 

The threat actors behind “Lurid Downloader” launched 301 malware campaigns 
targeting entities in speciﬁ c countries or geographic regions and tracked the success 
of each campaign by embedding a unique identiﬁ er in each instance of malware and 
associating it with speciﬁ c victims. While some campaigns resulted in numerous 
victims, others were very speciﬁ c and targeted resulting in only one or two victims. 
While previous Enfal activity has been typically associated with threat actors in China, it 
remains unclear who is behind the Lurid Downloader attacks.

INTRODUCTION

Prior to the highly publicized “Aurora” attack on Google in late 2009, which also 
affected at least 20 other companies, there was little public awareness regarding 
targeted malware attacks1.  However, such attacks have been taking place for years 
and continue to affect government, military, corporate, educational, and civil society 
networks today. While such attacks against the U.S. government and related networks 
are now fairly well-known, other governments and an increasing number of companies 
are facing similar threats.  Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States are also being targeted and compromised.  These countries have 
an expertise in the space industry and also have operations in oil & gas, mining and 
other industry areas that have been targeted by malware attacks in the past. 

Malware attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in popular software in order to compromise 
speciﬁ c target sets are becoming increasingly commonplace.  These attacks are not 
automated or indiscriminate nor are they conducted by opportunistic amateurs. Known 
as targeted malware attacks, these attacks refer to computer intrusions staged by 
threat actors that aggressively pursue and compromise speciﬁ c targets. Targeted 
malware attacks are typically part of broader campaigns, a series of failed and success 
compromises, by speciﬁ c threat actors and not isolated attacks. 

However, the speciﬁ city of the attacker’s prior knowledge of the victim affects the level 
of targeting associated with a single attack. As a result, some attacks appear to be 
less precise, or “noisy”, and are aimed at a broader community.  Such “spear phishing” 
attacks are usually “directed toward a group of people with a commonality” as opposed 
to a speciﬁ c target but are useful for gaining an initial foothold in a future target of 
interest2. 

The malware used in the “Lurid Downloader” attacks is commonly known as “Enfal” 
and it has been used in targeted attacks as far back as 20063.  In 2008, Maarten Van 
Horenbeeck documented a series of targeted malware attacks that made use the Enfal 
Trojan to target non-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) as well as defense contractors and U.S. government employees4.    In 2009 
and 2010, researchers from the University of Toronto published reports on two cyber-
espionage networks known as “GhostNet” and “ShadowNet” that included malware 
and command and control infrastructure connected with the Enfal Trojan5.   The 
domain names used by Enfal as command and control servers are, according to U.S. 
diplomatic cables leaked to Wikileaks, linked to a series of attacks known as “Byzantine 
Hades.”  According to these leaked cables, the activity of this set of threat actors has 
been ongoing since 2002 and is known as “Byzantine Hades”, and there are subsets 
of this activity known as “Byzantine Anchor,” “Byzantine Candor”  and “Byzantine 
Foothold”6.  However, it is important to note that other than the use of Enfal itself, 
there appears to be several distinct sets of command and control infrastructure in use 
and the relationship among the threat actors operating these separate infrastructures 
remains unclear.

The “Lurid Downloader” attacks appear to be another separate, but related Enfal 
network with a geographic focus. While there is clear evidence that the Tibetan 
community is also target, the victims of this attack are concentrated in Russia and 
other CIS countries. Numerous embassies and government ministries have been 
compromised as well as research institutions and agencies related to the space 
industry.

Our investigation began with an analysis of the “Lurid Downloader” malware. Our 
objective was to document its functionality and map out its command and control 
network. While this malware family is well known, there appear to be various 
associated threat actors using it to compromise targets in various geographic locations. 
Similar versions of this malware have been used to target both the U.S. government 
and NGO’s in the past. We could ﬁ nd no direct links between this particular command 
and control network and the previously discovered ones; we believe that it is most likely 
a separate, but related network as they appear to each have a regional focus.

We uncovered a command and control network that consists of 15 domains names 
and 10 IP addresses. We were able to retrieve a listing of the compromised computers 
connecting to these servers. In total, we found  1465 unique hosts (Hostname + Mac 
address as stored by the C&C) with 2272 unique external IP addresses connecting to 
the command and control network primarily from Russia (1063), Kazakhstan (325) and 
Ukraine (102) along with numerous other countries in the CIS (former Soviet Union).  

We were able to use reverse DNS and WHOIS lookups to determine the identity 
of 47 compromised hosts.  From the victims we were able to identify, there were 
concentrations of government ministries and diplomatic missions as well as space-
related government agencies, companies and research institutions.

We found that the attackers embedded campaign codes inside the malware they 
propagated in order to keep track of the success of their campaigns.  In total, we 
found 301 campaign codes and there are high concentrations of victims within a single 
country for each instance of the malware campaign indicating that the distribution of 
the malware is targeted at speciﬁ c countries or regions. In addition, nearly 60% of the 
campaigns only affected 1 or 2 victims indicating the precision with which the malware 
campaigns were conducted.

ATTACK VECTOR

In a typical targeted malware attack, a target typically receives a socially engineered 
message – such as an email or instant message – that encourages the target to click 
on a link or open a ﬁ le. The links and ﬁ les sent by the attacker contain malicious code 
that exploits vulnerabilities in popular software such as Adobe Reader (e.g. pdf’s) and 
Microsoft Ofﬁ ce (e.g. doc’s). The payload of these exploits is malware that is silently 
executed on the target’s computer. This allows the attackers to take control of the 
computer and obtain data from it. The attackers may then move laterally throughout the 
target’s network and are often able to maintain control over compromised computers 
for extended periods of time. Ultimately, the attacks locate and ex-ﬁ ltrate sensitive 
information from the victim’s network.

In this case, the delivery mechanism used was an email with a malicious PDF as an 
attachment. The email had no content, just a subject line and an attachment. The 
email message was spoofed to appear to be from ohhdl@dalailama.com, the Ofﬁ ce 
of the Dalai Lama and had a subject of “Tibetan Losar Event on 6 March 2011”. It also 
contained an attachment named “LOSAR FLYER_edited-3.pdf”.

The email was sent using an email provider called Gawab (gawab.com) which is 
popular in the Middle East. The server used was info3.gawab.com (66.220.20.18) 
and the email address was emb107@gawab.com. The originating IP address was: 
96.46.11.88 (INTERNETXTUSA). While this IP address is assigned to the US, it is used 
by a VPN provider in China7. 

If the attached PDF is opened with older versions of Adobe reader, malicious code 
is executed that drop malware on the target’s system. The malware then connects to 
a command and control server under the attacker’s control.  At this time, the target’s 
computer is compromised and under the full control of the attackers.

After successful exploitation, two malware components are created.  One is a dropper 
(ctfmon.exe) that installs a windows service. The service loads the dropped dll ﬁ le 
mspmsnsr.dll<long string of characters>. The malicious Windows service stores its 
conﬁ guration settings in the registry:

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WmdmPmSp\Parameters

This malware identiﬁ es itself as version 2.14. During the course of our investigation, we 
discovered another version of the malware that identiﬁ es itself as version 2.15.

isssync.exe

WORM_OTORUN.TMP

Instead of a Windows service, version 2.15 is just a single executable that copies itself 
to the system folder and ensures persistence by changing the common start folder of 
windows to a special one it creates. It then copies all the usual auto-start items there, 
as well as itself. The existence of this folder is constantly checked and redone if the 
user or any program switches it back to normal.

The Trojan collects information from the computer and sends it via HTTP POST. The 
information it collects is the following:

•  Computer name
•  MAC address
•  computer OS and version
•  IP address and codepage
•  language of the operating system.

It constantly communicates with a C&C server to perform certain info-stealing tasks. 
The main feature of the Trojan is that all communication is started by the client by http. 
Firewalls and other security devices will never see any communication from outside 
in. Even the interactive command line is built this way so everything is done from the 
inside out. The communication is always encrypted although it’s a simple XOR single-
byte encryption. This means that network security devices won’t readily see anything 
suspicious going on.

COMMUNICATION WITH THE COMMAND AND CONTROL SERVER

When malware is executed on the target’s system it “checks in” with one or more 
servers under the control of the attackers. Command and control mechanisms allow the 
threat actors to conﬁ rm that an attack has succeeded in addition to supplying them with 
some information about the target’s computer and network. From here on, the client 
communicates back to the control server expecting a command, allowing the attackers 
to issue commands to the compromised target.  

All of the connections to the command and control servers use the HTTP protocol and 
request speciﬁ c URL paths.  On startup, the malware connects to the command and 
control server and requests the path “/trandocs/mm/”  (the path may differ with other 
samples, for example “httpdocs/mm/ or /iupw82/netstate”). This appears to be a LOGIN 
connection and the server always responds with “123”.  The data transmitted to the 
command and control server consists of the following:

Encrypted Password/<hostname>:<MAC>/<ip address>
<OS name>
<codepage>:<locale>
<actual exe name>
<campaign name>
<y/n> (sys32time.ini exists? Is it 1Mb or bigger?)
<y/n> (ipop.dll exists?)
<y/n> (always n in our samples)
<malware version> (2.14 or 2.15)

The encrypted password at the beginning of the LOGIN packet only appears on version 
2.15. The sample we analyzed contains the password “hallelujah” and it is encrypted 
with “ADD +FAh”.  The earlier version, 2.14, does not contain a password at all.

After the initial connection, the malware makes two kinds of connections to the 
command and control server every 2 minutes. The ﬁ rst connection is a KEEPALIVE 
connection to the URL path “/cgl-bin/Owpq4.cgi”. The malware posts information to the 
command and control server that identiﬁ es the compromised machine: OS and version, 
“campaign ID” and malware version. The second connection is an ASKCMD connection 
to a URL with the path “/trandocs/mm/ <machine_name>:<MAC address>/Cmwhite”.  
The contents of “Cmwhite” contain commands that are sent by the attackers to the 
compromised computer. The range of possible commands will be discussed below.

When the command ﬁ le, “Cmwhite” is downloaded, the malware ﬁ rst acknowledges the 
receipt of the command by issuing an ACKCMD connection to “/cgl-bin/Clnpp5.cgi”.  
Once the command is interpreted and performed, the malware issues a CMDDONE 
request to “/cgl-bin/Rwpq1.cgi”. It contains the results of the command and, if relevant, 
a result code that indicates any error encountered.  When there is no command set 
by the attackers for the victim computer, the command and control server returns a 
“404 NOT FOUND” error page. This is never interpreted correctly as a command and 
therefore ignored.

COMMANDS

The command packet that is contained within the  “Cmwhite” response is encrypted. In 
the samples we analyzed, it is encrypted with XOR 45h. Other communication packets 
observed suggest that there are other keys in use but they are always a single byte. 
Once decrypted, this is what a command packet contains:

First two bytes: 40 40. (This is just a magic number).
Third byte: Command code.
Fourth byte: Return code. (This only used in the CMDDONE packet to indicate 
error/success).
From the Fifth byte on, the command carries parameters, which vary depending 
on the nature of the command. 

The range of commands available to the attackers that are enumerated below 
demonstrate the level of control the attackers have over their victims. In addition to 
functionality that allows the attackers to send and receive ﬁ les, they are able to activate 
an interactive remote shell on compromised systems. 

Range of commands

Command 01   ECHO

It echoes back the word contained in bytes 5 and 6. There’s another 
parameter, which is supposed to contain the string “ibme54”. If this 
is right, it keeps an internal counter of how many of these ECHO 
packets, it has received.

Command 02  

IPOP LOAD CHECK

It checks if the previous check for the ﬁ le c:\windows\system32\ipop.
dll was successful. It returns a y/n condition.

Command 03   SEND FILE

Command 04 

RECV FILE

When the client receives this command, it retrieves a ﬁ le and sends 
it to the C&C server. The ﬁ lename is a parameter in the command 
packet.

This command has two parameters, the ﬁ lename and the data. The 
client creates the ﬁ le with the data in the packet. It does this by 
constantly communicating with a Ufwhite URL. This URL is accessed 
repeatedly in order to keep receiving chunks of the data ﬁ le and 
appending it to the ﬁ le. When there’s no more data, the ﬁ le is closed 
and operation is ﬁ nished. After each packet is correctly received, 
the client sends a report packet to Clnpp5.cgi specifying that it was 
Ufwhite who started this operation.

Command 05   CMDEXEC

It accepts a single command and executes it in the victim system.

Command 06   DELETE FILE

It accepts a ﬁ lename string as a parameter. It deletes the ﬁ le.

Command 07  MOVE FILE

It accepts two ﬁ lenames. It moves the ﬁ le from source to target 
destination.

Command 09  

LS

Command 0A  

INTERACTIVE MODE

When the client receives this command, its proceeds to list the ﬁ les 
within a speciﬁ ed directory and sends the list back in a response 
packet.

When the client receives this command, it stays in interactive mode. 
It starts connecting to Clnpp5.cgi expecting a command. These 
commands are then executed and error codes sent straight away 
until an “exit” command is received. The interactive commands 
have a special tag to set them apart from regular commands. This 
tag is “1234”. The way this interactive system is implemented is the 
following: The command is run in the same way as command 05 but 
the output is redirected to a ﬁ le (c:\Documents and Settings\<user>\
SendTo\msacm.dat). The contents of the ﬁ le are then sent in the 
return packet to Clnpp5.cgi. Once the “exit” command has been 
received, this mode is interrupted. While this mode is going on, the 
Trojan still sends keepalive and regular command requests packets.

Command 0B   MKDIR

The client creates a directory

Command 0E

TERMINATE 
PROCESS

Command 10   EXEC NFAL

The client tries to terminate a given thread in the system.

When this command is received, the client tries to execute the ﬁ le c:\
windows\system32\nfal.exe. This ﬁ le does not exist on an infected 
system normally so it must be a placeholder for a command ﬁ le 
uploaded to the victim.

Command 40

PING

When this command is received, the Trojan just sends back an empty 
packet with a success code condition.

TOOL MARKS

The terms “tool marks” refers to characteristics contained within malware that indicate 
that they are part of the same campaign or related to speciﬁ c threat actors8.  In this 
case, the attackers left the PDB path in the malware samples we analyzed which 
indicate the name of the project:

e:\programs\LuridDownLoader\LuridDownloader for 
Falcon\DllServiceTrojan\Release\DllServiceTrojan.pdb
e:\programs\LuridDownLoader\LuridDownloader for Falcon\ServiceDll\Release\
ServiceDll.pdb

We named this campaign of targeted attacks “Lurid DownLoader” based on the project 
name the attackers have given to their own malware.

COMMAND AND CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE

Attackers often maintain a network of command and control servers, not just a single 
one. Often, the malware used in targeted attacks contains one or more command and 
control locations. By linking together the domain names that are present in related 
malware samples, along with domain names registered by the same email address and 
domain names hosted on the same web servers we were able to map out the command 
and control infrastructure of the attackers.

In total, we found 15 domain names associated with the attackers and 10 active IP 
addresses. The domain names were registered by two different email addresses 
“bruce_tuner@yahoo.com” and “icqmaster@163.com”.

Rather than use the “root” domains, the attackers use a variety of sub-domains. These 
various sub-domains resolve to 10 different IP address spread across 3 different 
IP address ranges assigned to 2 providers: Krypt Technologies in the U.S. and 
UK2/100mb in the U.K.

After mapping out and monitoring the command and control network used in this 
campaign we were able to retrieve a listing of the compromised computers connecting 
to these servers. This list of compromised computers contains  1465 unique hosts 
(Hostname + Mac address as stored by the C&C) with 2272 unique external IP 
addresses connecting to the command and control network primarily from Russia 
(1063), Kazakhstan (325) and Ukraine (102) along with numerous other countries in 
the CIS (former Soviet Union).  There were also signiﬁ cant numbers of compromises 
in Vietnam, India, Mongolia and China. In total, there were victims in 61 different 
countries.

The data covers compromised computers that connected to the command and control 
servers in June and July 2011. The top 10 countries of victims (based on the 2272 IP 
addresses) are:

MALWARE CAMPAIGNS

As noted earlier, there is a unique identiﬁ er built in to instances of the malware sent 
out by the attackers that allows them to keep track of the computers compromised 
by speciﬁ c campaigns. In total, we found 301 campaign codes. This means that the 
attackers sent out at least 301 different instances of the “Lurid Downloader.” There are 
high concentrations of victims within a single country for each instance of the malware 
campaign indicating that the distribution of the malware is targeted at speciﬁ c countries 
or regions.

There were also speciﬁ c campaigns that affected a very small number of victims. In 
fact, nearly 60% (59.4%) of all the campaigns affected only 1 or 2 victims.  There 
were 115 campaigns that only compromised 1 victim and 64 campaigns that only 
compromised 2 victims. This indicates the precision in malware campaigns that target 
speciﬁ c entities.

DATA EX-FILTRATION

While we were unable to recover the data obtained by the attackers, we were able to 
collect some of the command issued by the attackers that hint at their objectives.  We 
found that the attackers often issued the “LS” command to send a directory listing from 
speciﬁ c directories on the compromised computers back to the command and control 
server. We also observed the use of the “SEND FILE” that ordered the compromised 
computers to compress, split and upload speciﬁ c ﬁ les (.rar, .xls, .doc) to the command 
and control server. However, we were unable to recover the ex-ﬁ ltrated data.

ATTRIBUTION

Determining who is ultimately behind targeted malware attacks is difﬁ cult as it requires 
a combination of technical and contextual analysis and the ability to connect disparate 
pieces of information together over a period of time.  Moreover, any one researcher 
typically does not necessarily have all these pieces of information and must interpret 
the available evidence. Too often, the determination of attribution is based on easily 
spoofed evidence such as IP addresses.  While many of these attacks are attributed to 
China, in this case, the IP addresses of the command and control servers were located 
in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the registration information 
of the domain names used indicates that the owners are in China. In either case, the 
information is not difﬁ cult to manipulate.

The use of “Enfal”, the family of malware to which “Lurid Downloader” belongs, has 
been historically linked with threat actors in China. In this case, the attack vector 
that we were able to analyze was related to the Tibetan community which indicates 
an association with China. However, China was also a victim of “Lurid Downloader.” 

CONCLUSION

In this report we have analyzed targeted malware attacks that have compromised 
sensitive locations in Russia, CIS countries and around the world. The focus of the 
attacks appears to be on government networks and diplomatic missions as well and 
research institutions and space related agencies. We found that the attackers engaged 
in over 300 campaigns and kept careful records of their victims and to what campaign 
compromised them.  Our analysis of the campaigns reveals that attackers engage 
in attacks that target communities in speciﬁ c geographic locations as well extremely 
targeted campaigns that only affect one or two victims. 

The precise nature of targeted malware attacks increases the difﬁ culty of defense. With 
signiﬁ cant reconnaissance, and possibly information gained from previously successful 
incursions into the target’s network, the threat actors behind targeted malware attacks 
are able to customize their attacks to increase the probability of success. Therefore, 
defenses against targeted malware attacks need to focus on detection and mitigation 
and not simply on prevention.  

Through the exposure of the “Lurid Downloader” network, we aim to enable a better 
understanding of the extent and frequency of such attacks as well as the challenges 
that targeted malware attacks pose for traditional defenses. Defensive strategies can 
be dramatically improved by understanding how targeted malware attacks work as well 
as trends in the tools, tactics and procedures of the threat actors behind such attacks. 
By effectively using threat intelligence derived from external and internal sources 
combined with security tools that empower human analysts, organizations are better 
positioned to detect and mitigate targeted malware attacks.
