Preface

This  report  is  devoted  to  the  analysis  of  the  notorious  Stuxnet  worm  (Win32/Stuxnet)  that  suddenly 
attracted the  attention of virus researchers this summer. This report is primarily  intended to describe 
targeted  and  semi-targeted  attacks,  and  how  they  are  implemented,  focusing  mainly  on  the  most 
recent, namely Stuxnet. This attack is, however, compared to the Aurora attack, outlining the similarities 
and differences between the two attacks. 

The  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  In  the  first  section  we  introduce  the  targeted  attacks  and  their 
common  characteristics  and  goals.  In  this  section  we  present  comparison  of  two  attacks:  Stuxnet  vs. 
Aurora. The second section contains some general information on SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data 
Acquisition)  systems  and  PLCs  (Programmable  Logic  Controllers)  as  Stuxnet’s  primary  targets  of.  The 
third  section  covers  the  distribution  of  the  Stuxnet  worm.  Here  we  describe  vulnerabilities  that  it 
exploits to infect the target machine. The next section describes the implementation of Stuxnet: user-
mode  and  kernel-mode  components,  RPC  Server  and  their  interconnection.  We  also  describe  the 
remote communication protocol that it uses to communicate with the remote C&C.

This  section  contains  information  on  targeted  attacks  and  its  characteristics.  In  particular,  we  discuss 
two types of attacks: attacks targeting a specific company or organization, and attacks targeting specific 
software and IT infrastructure. We do this by comparing two outstanding examples of these two species 
of  attack:  Aurora  and  Stuxnet.  This  chapter  provides  information  on  some  intriguing  facts  related  to 
Stuxnet, such as timestamps of its binaries, and information on compiler versions which might be useful 
in analysis of the malware. We end with statistics relating to Stuxnet distribution all over the world. 

Recently,  there  has  been  increased  public  awareness  and  information  about  targeted  attacks  as  the 
number of such attacks has significantly increased, becoming a separate cybercriminal business sector in 
its own right.  

Many companies are reluctant to disclose information about attempted or successful targeted attacks 
for fear of public relations issues affecting their profits, so the information made available to the public 
only represents a small part of what is actually happening. 

1.1  Targeted Attacks 

All targeted attacks can be divided into two major classes: 

Targeting a specific company or organization - this type of attack is directed at a specific 
 
organization and the aim of an intruder is unauthorized access to confidential information such 
as commercial secrets (as with the Aurora attack). 
Targeting specific software or IT infrastructure - this type of attack is not directed at a 
 
specific  company  and  its  target  is  the  data  associated  with  a  certain  kind  of  software,  for 
example -banking client software or SCADA systems. Such attacks have to be implemented in a 
more  flexible  manner.  This  class  of  attacks  can  do  much  more  damage  to  a  great  number  of 
companies than the attacks of the first class. As this class pre-supposes a long term attack, it is 
designed to circumvent protection systems (as with the Stuxnet attack). 

The most common vector for the development of targeted external attacks is now considered to be the 
exploitation of vulnerabilities in popular client-side applications (browsers, plugins and so on). Attackers 
typically use combinations of multiple steps, which allow them to take root on the client-side. In most 
cases the first stage of the attack employs social engineering to allow an attacker to lure the victim to a 
favorable environment for the implementation of the next attack phase. 

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

Figure 1.1 – Typical Stages of Client-Side Attack  

 

Bypassing the security software installed in certain organizations is a crucial objective for most malware. 
There is a separate cybercriminal business sector devoted to providing the means for malicious software 
to stay undetected by specific or widely spread antivirus products. 

 

 

Figure 1.2 – Custom Malware Protector 

 

This  kind  of  service  can  extend  the  life  of  outdated  malware,  or  extend  the  time  new  threats  stay 
undetected. However, the use of such technologies to resist detection by antivirus software can be used 
as a heuristic for the detection of previously unknown samples. But the converse case also holds true: 
avoiding using any techniques aimed at bypassing antivirus software and making the program resemble 
legitimate software more closely can be a way of protecting malware. This is the case with the attack 
mechanism used by the Stuxnet worm.  

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

The  Stuxnet  attack  constituted  a  serious  threat  to  trust  in  software  using  legal  digital  signatures.  This 
creates a problem for white-listing, where security software is based on the a priori assumption that a 
trusted program meets certain conditions and is therefore indeed trustworthy. And what if the program 
closely resembles legitimate software and even has digital certificates for installed modules published in 
the name of reputable companies? All this suggests that targeted attacks could persist much longer over 
time than we previously imagined. Stuxnet was able to stay undetected for a substantial period where 
no one saw anything suspicious. The use of a self-launching, 0-day vulnerability in the attack allowed the 
rapid  distribution  of  Stuxnet  in  the  targeted  region.  The  choice  of  this  kind  of  vulnerability  is  quite 
deliberate,  because  in  the  absence  of  information  about  its  existence,  use  of  the  exploit  will  not  be 
detected. All these facts suggest a well-planned attack which remained unnoticed until long after it was 
launched. But it is precisely the existence of such threats that inspires us to look at the new vector and 
the possibility of attacks that use it, in order to reduce the impact of future attacks. 

1.2 

Stuxnet versus Aurora  

In the past year, the public has become aware of two targeted attacks, codenamed Stuxnet and Aurora. 
Both of these attacks have some common features that characterize recent trends in targeted attacks. 
Nowadays,  the  most  popular  vector  of  penetration  of  the  user’s  machine  is  realized  through  popular 
client-side applications (browsers, plugins and other apps). It is much easier to steal data by launching 
an indirect attack on people with access to important information via a malicious web site, than it is to 
attack  the  company’s  well-protected  database  server  directly.  The  use  of  client-side  applications  as  a 
vector of attack  is  undoubtedly expected by cautious system users and administrators, but this  attack 
methodology  is  less  predictable  and  harder  to  protect  against,  since  in  everyday  life  we  use  many 
applications, each of them potentially an attack vector. 

The Aurora and Stuxnet attacks used 0-day exploits to install malicious programs onto the system. Table 
1.2.1 presents data on the malicious programs and exploits used:

The  exploit  ESET  detects  as  JS/Exploit.CVE-2010-0249  (MS10-002)  has  a  narrower  range  of  possible 
vectors of distribution than LNK/Exploit.CVE-2010-2568 (MS10-046). The range of vulnerabilities used in 
the  Stuxnet  attack  have  other  interesting  features  making  use  of  such  infection  vectors  as  removable 
flash drives and other USB devices, and resources shared over the network. The exploit LNK/Exploit.CVE-
2010-2568 is by its nature so designed that detection of the exploit’s malicious activity is impossible, if 
you  are  not  aware  of  its  existence.  If  we  compare  the  features  of  these  two  exploits,  it  seems  that 
JS/Exploit.CVE-2010-0249  is designed for a surprise attack,  while  in  the case  of LNK/Exploit.CVE-2010-
2568  a  long-term,  persistent  attack  was  intended.  An  additional  propagation  vector  (MS10-061)  can 
spread rapidly  within the  local network.  These  observations confirm the data  from Table  1.2.3, which 
compares the characteristics of the malicious programs used in these attacks.

These two attacks have shown us that no information system is absolutely secure and carefully planned 
targeted or even semi-targeted attacks put a serious weapon into the hands of bad guys. In the case of 
Stuxnet there are still a lot of open questions, in our report we try to highlight the technical component 
of this semi-targeted attack. Stuxnet showed us by example how much can be conceived and achieved 
using massive semi-targeted attacks.  

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

Why semi-targeted? While the payload is plainly focused on SCADA systems, the malware’s propagation 
is  promiscuous.  Criminal  (and  nation-state  funded)  malware  developers  have  generally  moved  away 
from the use of self-replicating malware towards Trojans spread by other means (spammed URLs, PDFs 
and  Microsoft  Office  documents  compromised  with  0-day  exploits,  and  so  on).  Once  self-replicating 
code is released, it’s difficult to exercise complete control over where it goes, what it does, and how far 
it spreads (which is one of the reasons reputable researchers have always been opposed to the use of 
“good”  viruses  and  worms:  for  the  bad  guys,  it  also  has  the  disadvantage  that  as  malware  becomes 
more  prevalent  and  therefore  more  visible,  its  usefulness  in  terms  of  payload  delivery  is  depleted  by 
public awareness and the wider availability of protection). 

As  we  describe  elsewhere  in  this  document,  there  were  probably  a  number  of  participants  in  the 
Stuxnet  development  project  who  may  have  very  different  backgrounds.  However,  some  of  the  code 
looks as if it originated with a "regular" software developer with extensive knowledge of SCADA systems 
and/or Siemens control systems, rather than with the criminal gangs responsible for most malcode, or 
even the  freelance  hacker groups,  sometimes thought  to be  funded by governments and the military, 
(for example Wicked  Rose)  we  often  associate with targeted  attacks.  However,  it’s  feasible  that  what 
we’re  seeing  here  is  the  work  of  a  more  formally-constituted,  multi-disciplinary  “tiger  team”.  Such 
officially  but  unpublicized  collaborations,  resembling  the  cooperative  work  with  other  agencies  that 
anti-malware researchers sometimes engage in, might be more common than we are actually aware. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  nature  of  the  .LNK  vulnerability  means  that  even  though  the  mechanism  is 
different to the Autorun mechanism exploited by so much malware in recent years, its use for delivery 
through USB devices, removable media, and network shares, has resulted in wide enough propagation 
to prevent the malware from remaining “below the radar”. This may signify misjudgement on the part of 
a  development  team  that  nevertheless  succeeded  in  putting  together  a  sophisticated  collaborative 
project, or a miscommunication at some point in the development process. On the other hand, it may 
simply mean that the group was familiar enough with the modus operandi characteristic of SCADA sites 
to gamble on the likelihood that Stuxnet would hit enough poorly-defended, poorly-patched and poorly-
regulated PLCs to gain them the information and control they wanted. Since at the time of writing it has 
been  reported  by various sources  that  some  14 or 15  SCADA  sites  have  been directly  affected  by  the 
infection of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), the latter proposition may have some validity. While 
the use of these vectors has increased the visibility of the threat, it’s likely that it has also enabled access 
to  sites where  “air-gapped”  generic  defences  were  prioritized over  automated technical  defences  like 
anti-virus,  and  less  automated  system  updating  and  patching.  This  is  not  a minor  consideration,  since 
the withdrawal of support from Windows versions earlier than Windows XP SP3. At the same time, it’s 
clear  that  there  are  difficulties  for  some  sites  where  protective  measures  may  involve  taking  critical 
systems offline. While there are obvious concerns here concerning SPoFs (single points of failure), the 
potential problems associated with fixing such issues retrospectively should not be underestimated.

Stuxnet Revealed 

1.3

During our research, we have been constantly finding evidence confirming that the Stuxnet attack was 
carefully  prepared.  Timestamp  in  the  file  ~wtr4141.tmp  indicates  that  the  date  of  compilation  was 
03/02/2010. 

Figure 1.3 – Header Information from ~wtr4141.tmp 

 

Version 9.0 of the linker indicated that attackers used MS Visual Studio 2008 for developing Stuxnet's 
components.  File  ~wtr4141.tmp  is  digitally  signed,  and  the  timestamp  indicates  that  the  signature  on 
the date of signing coincides with the time of compilation. 

 

Figure 1.4 – Digital Signature Information from ~wtr4141.tmp 

 

Examination of the driver is even more interesting, since the timestamp of MRXCLS.sys indicates that it 
was compiled on 01/01/2009. An 8.0 version of the linker used to build it suggests that MS Visual Studio 
2005 was for development. Using different versions of the linker may indicate as well that this project 
was developed by a group of people with a clear division of responsibilities. 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

Figure 1.5 – Header information from MRXCLS.sys 

 

The digital signature shows a later date 25/01/2010, indicating that this module, was available very early 
on, or was borrowed from another project.

The second driver was built later and a timestamp of compilation shows 25/01/2010, coinciding with the 
date  of  signature  of  the  driver  MRXCLS.sys.  The  same  linker  version  was  used  and  maybe  these  two 
drivers were created by one and the same person.

The timestamp signature also coincides, and it all seems to point to the date of release for this 
component.

Figure 1.8 – Digital Signature Information from MRXNET.sys 

 

On July 17th, ESET identified a new driver named jmidebs.sys, compiled on July 14th 2010, and signed 
with a certificate from a company called "JMicron Technology Corp".  This is different from the previous 
drivers which were signed with the certificate from Realtek Semiconductor Corp.  It is interesting to note 
that  both  companies  whose  code  signing  certificates  were  used  have  offices  in  Hsinchu  Science  Park, 
Taiwan.  The  physical  proximity  of  the  two  companies  may  suggest  physical  theft,  but  it's  also  been 
suggested  that  the  certificates  may  have  been  bought  from  another  source.  For  instance,  the  Zeus 
botnet  is  known  to  steal  certificates,  though  it  probably  focuses  on  banking  certificates.  (As  Randy 
Abrams pointed out: http://blog.eset.com/2010/07/22/why-steal-digital-certificates) 

The file  jmidebs.sys functions in much the  same  way as the earlier  system drivers, injecting code  into 
processes running on an infected machine. As Pierre-Marc Bureau pointed out in a blog at the time, it 
wasn't clear whether the attackers changed their certificate because the first one was exposed, or were 
simply  using  different  certificates  for  different  attacks.  Either  way,  they  obviously  have  significant 
resources to draw on. The well-planned modular architecture that characterizes the Stuxnet malware, 
and  the  large  number  of modules  used,  suggests  the  involvement  of  a  fairly  large  and  well-organized 
group. (See: http://blog.eset.com/2010/07/19/win32stuxnet-signed-binaries).

Another interesting finding was the string b:\myrtus\src\objfre_w2k_x86\i386\guava.pdb found in the 
resource section.

Figure 1.10 – Interesting String in MRXNET.sys 

 

The number of modules included in Stuxnet and the bulkiness of the developed code indicate that this 
malicious  program  was  developed  by  a  large  group  of  people.  Stuxnet  is  a  more  mature  and 
technologically advanced (semi-)targeted attack than Aurora.

Statistics on the Spread of the Stuxnet Worm

The  statistical  distribution  of  infected  machines  Win32/Stuxnet  globally,  from  the  beginning  of  the 
detection to the end of September, is presented in the figure below:  

 

Figure 1.11 – Global infection by Win32/Stuxnet (Top 14 Countries) 

 

Asian  countries  are  the  leaders  with  the  largest  number  of  Stuxnet-infected  machines  by.  Iran  is  the 
region where the widest spread Stuxnet has been seen. If we look at the percentage distribution of the 
number of infections by region, we can generate the following table:

A  high  volume  of  detections  in  a  single  region  may  mean  that  it  is  the  major  target  of  attackers. 
However, multiple targets may exist, and the promiscuous nature of the infective mechanism is likely to 
targeting detail. In fact, even known infection of a SCADA site isn’t  incontrovertible  evidence  that  the 
site  was  specifically  targeted.  It  has  been  suggested  that  malware  could  have  been  spread  via  flash 
drives  distributed  at  a  SCADA  conference  or  event  (as  Randy  Abrams  pointed  out  in  a  blog  at 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

http://blog.eset.com/2010/07/19/which-army-attacked-the-power-grids.  Even 
that  would  argue 
targeting  of  the  sector  rather  than  individual  sites,  and  that  targeting  is  obvious  from  the  payload. 
Distribution,  however,  is  influenced  by  a  number  of  factors  apart  from  targeting,  such  as  local 
availability  of  security  software  and  adherence  to  good  update/patching  practice.  Furthermore,  our 
statistics  show  that  the  distribution  of  infections  from  the  earliest  days  of  detection  shows  a  steep 
decline even in heavily-affected Iran in the days following the initial discovery of the attack, followed by 
a more gradual decline over subsequent months. 

However,  the  sparse  information  we  have  about  actual  infection  of  SCADA  sites  using  (and  affecting) 
Siemens software suggests that about a third of the sites affected are in the German process industry 
sector.  Siemens  have  not  reported  finding  any  active  instances  of  the  worm:  in  other  words,  it  has 
checked out PLCs at these sites, but it hasn’t attempted to manipulate them. Heise observes that: 

“The  worm  seems  to look for  specific  types  of  systems  to manipulate.  Siemens  couldn't  provide 
any details about which systems precisely are or could be affected.” 

(http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Stuxnet-also-found-at-industrial-plants-in-Germany-
1081469.html)  

Comprehensive analysis of how Stuxnet behaves when it hits a vulnerable installation was published by 
Ralph Langner, ahead of the ACS conference in Rockville in September 2010.  

However, the Langner  analysis  is contradicted in some crucial respects by analysis from other sources 
(http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/exploring-stuxnet-s-plc-infection-process).  There  was  also 
some fascinating conjecture on display in an interview with Joe Weiss. 

(http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/interviews/weiss.html) 

Joe (Joseph) Weiss is, incidentally, the author of “Protecting  Industrial  Control  Systems  from  Electronic 
Threats”, ISBN: 978-1-60650-197-9,  which sounds  well  worth investigating for a closer  look at industrial 
control  systems  (ICS)  and  security.  The  Amazon  page  http://www.amazon.com/Protecting-Industrial-
Control-Systems-Electronic/dp/1606501976  includes  pointers  to  some  other  books  on  related  topics  as 
well as some very positive commentary on Joe’s book.

2  Microsoft, Malware and the Media 

This  section  contains  information  on  events  that  have  taken  place  since  the  original  outbreak  of  the 
Stuxnet malware. While a full-scale account of the media coverage around these events would be a long 
document in its own right, we present here a partial timeline which puts some of the most significant 
events in chronological order, ranging from initial detection on 17th of June until the date of release of 
this Revision. This section also contains a table (Table 2.2.1) that details posts on Stuxnet in ESET’s blog. 
A number of other links are also given non-chronologically so that the reader can track other resources 
covering various topics related to Stuxnet. 

While Stuxnet exploits several Windows vulnerabilities, at least four of them described as 0-day: 

MS08-067 RPC Exploit (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-

 
067.mspx)  

MS10-046 LNK Exploit (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-

 
046.mspx)  

 

MS10-061 Spool Server Exploit 

 
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-061.mspx) 

 

Two privilege escalation (or Elevation of Privilege) vulnerabilities: 

o  MS10-073 Win32k.sys Exploit 

(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-073.mspx) 

o  MS10-092  Task Scheduler Exploit 

(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-092.mspx) 

However, it also targets PLCs (Programming Logic Controllers) on sites using Siemens SIMATIC WinCC or 
STEP 7 SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems.  

2.1 

SCADA, Siemens and Stuxnet 

This attack makes additional use of a further vulnerability categorized as CVE-2010-2772, relating to the 
use of a hard-coded password in those systems allowing a local user to access a back-end database and 
gain privileged access to the system. This meant not only that the password was exposed to an attacker 
through  reverse  engineering,  but,  in  this  case,  that  the  system  would  not  continue  to  work  if  the 
password  was  changed,  though  that  issue  was  not  mentioned  in  Siemens’  advice  to  its  customers  at 
http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/43876783.  Industrial  Controls  Engineer  Jake 
Brodsky  made  some  very  pertinent  comments 
to  David  Harley’s  blog  at 
http://blog.eset.com/2010/07/20/theres-passwording-and-theres-security.  

response

While agreeing that strategically, Siemens were misguided to keep hardcoding the same access account 
and  password  into  the  products  in  question,  and  naive  in  expecting  those  details  to  stay  secret,  Jake 
pointed  out,  perfectly  reasonably,  that  tactically,  it  would  be  impractical  for  many  sites  to  take 
appropriate  remedial measures  without  a  great  deal  of  preparation,  recognizing  that  a  critical  system 
can’t  be  taken  down  without  implementing  interim  maintenance  measures.  He  suggested,  therefore, 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

that  isolation  of  affected  systems  from  the  network  was  likely  to  be  a  better  short-term  measure, 
combined  with  the  interim  measures  suggested  by  Microsoft  for  working  around  the  .LNK  and  .PIF 
issues that were causing concern at the time (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2286198).

Stuxnet Timeline  

2.2

VirusBlokAda reportedly detected Stuxnet components as Trojan-Spy.0485 and Malware-
Cryptor.Win32.Inject.gen on 17th June 2010 (http://www.anti-virus.by/en/tempo.shtml), and also 
described the .LNK vulnerability on which most of the subsequent attention was focused. However, it 
seems that Microsoft, like most of the security industry, only became aware (or publicly acknowledged) 
the problem in July. (See: http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2010/09/13/september-2010-
security-bulletin-release.aspx) 

Realtek Semiconductor were notified of the theft of their digital signature keys on 24th June 2010. 
(http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/new_rootkit_en.pdf).  

ESET was already detecting some components of the attack generically early in July 2010, but the 
magnitude of the problem only started to become obvious later that month. Siemens don’t seem to 
have been notified (or at any rate acknowledged receipt of notification) until 14th July 2010. 
http://www.sea.siemens.com/us/News/Industrial/Pages/WinCC_Update.aspx.sea.siemens.com/us/New
s/Industrial/Pages/WinCC_Update.aspx. On the same day, another driver was compiled as subsequently 
revealed by ESET analysis and reported on 19th July: http://blog.eset.com/2010/07/19/win32stuxnet-
signed-binaries 

On the 15th July, Brian Krebs was, as usual, ahead of the pack at 
http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/experts-warn-of-new-windows-shortcut-flaw/ in pointing out that 
there was a control systems issue. Advisories were posted by US-CERT and ICS-CERT 
(http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/940193; http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-201-
01%20-%20USB%20Malware%20Targeting%20Siemens%20Control%20Software.pdf.)  

 

A Microsoft advisory was posted on 16th July 
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx), supplemented by a Technet 
blog (http://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2010/07/16/the-stuxnet-sting.aspx). The Internet 
Storm Center also commented: http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=9181. See also MITRE Common

On the 17th July, the Verisign certificate assigned to Realtek Semiconductor was revoked 
(http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/verisign-revokes-certificate-used-sign-stuxnet-malware-071710). 
However, the second driver, now using a JMicron certificate was identified: 
http://blog.eset.com/2010/07/19/win32stuxnet-signed-binaries. The first of a comprehensive series of 
ESET blogs was posted.

Stuxnet Code: Chicken Licken or Chicken Run? 

MS10-092 and Stuxnet 

On the 19th SANS posted an advisory regarding the .LNK vulnerability 
(http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=9190), and on the 19th and 20th July Siemens updated its posts: 
http://www.sea.siemens.com/us/News/Industrial/Pages/WinCC_Update.aspx 

ESET labs were now seeing low-grade Autorun worms, written in Visual Basic, experimenting with the 
.LNK vulnerability, and had added generic detection of the exploit (LNK/Exploit.CVE-2010-2568). Most 
AV companies had Stuxnet-specific detection by now, of course. Some of the malware using the same 
vulnerability that appeared around that time was described by David Harley in a Virus Bulletin article, 
“Chim Chymine: a Lucky Sweep?” published in September 2010. 

The Internet Storm Center raised its Infocon level to yellow in order to raise awareness of the issue 
(http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=9190). Softpedia and Computerworld, among others, noted the 
publication of exploit code using the .LNK vulnerability. 

Wired magazine reported that it was well-known that some Siemens products made use of hard-coded 
passwords, as described above: http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/tag/siemens/ 

 

Siemens has made quite a few advisories available, but has not really addressed the hard-coded 
password issue directly, and some pages appear to have been withdrawn at the time of writing. The 
following pages were still available: 

http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/llisapi.dll?func=cslib.csinfo&lang=en&obji

 
d=43876783&caller=view 

http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/llisapi.dll?func=cslib.csinfo&objId=43876
 
783&objAction=csOpen&nodeid0=10805449&lang=en&siteid=cseus&aktprim=0&extranet=stan
dard&viewreg=WW  

A number of new malware families were identified using same vulnerability in late July, and a number of 
other families such as Win32/Sality generated new variants that also used it. 
Win32/TrojanDownloader.Chymine.A downloads Win32/Spy.Agent.NSO keylogger; 
Win32/Autorun.VB.RP, and is similar to malware described by ISC on 21st July 
(http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=9229 ), but updated to include the CVE-2010-2568 exploit for 
propagation.  

Pierre-Marc Bureau and David Harley blogged on the subject at http://blog.eset.com/2010/07/22/new-
malicious-lnks-here-we-go, and Harley explored the issues further in “Shortcuts to Insecurity: .LNK 
Exploits” at http://securityweek.com/shortcuts-insecurity-lnk-exploits, and “Chim Chymine: a lucky 
sweep?” in the September issue of Virus Bulletin.

patch-tuesday/article/178911/?DCMP=EMC-SCUK_Newswire.  

Microsoft released a security update to address the Print Spooler Service vulnerability used by Stuxnet. 
The vulnerability only exists where a printer is shared, which is not a default.

Further fixes promised for two Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities. 

Ralph Langner’s  analysis  of how  Stuxnet  affects  a vulnerable installation was further discussed at the 
ACS conference in September 2010, but AV industry analysis did not fully concur.

Much  of  the  earlier  controversy  about  the  origin  and  targeting  of  Stuxnet  derived  from  uncertainty 
about  exactly  what  its  code  was  meant  to  do.  Even  after  it  was  established  that  it  was  intended  to 
modify PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) code, details of the kind of installation targeted remained 
unclear. 

However,  research  into  this  aspect  of  the  Stuxnet  code  by  Symantec  et  al,  blogged  by  Eric  Chien  at 
http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/stuxnet-breakthrough,  told  us  that  "Stuxnet  requires  the 
industrial control system to have frequency converter drives from at least one of two specific vendors, 
one  headquartered  in  Finland  and  the  other  in  Tehran,  Iran.    This  is  in  addition  to  the  previous 
requirements we discussed of a S7-300 CPU and a CP-342-5 Profibus communications module." He goes 
on  to  describe  in  some  detail  the  workings  of  the  relevant  Stuxnet  code.  Symantec's  hefty  Stuxnet 
dossier was updated accordingly.  

This didn’t  put a complete end to the speculation, of course. In fact, some  of the  speculation actually 
grew  wilder.  Most  notably,  Sky  News,  tired  of  mere  factual  reporting  and  even  half-informed 
speculation, took off for planet Fantasy, where it discovered that the Sky really is falling, claiming that 
the  “super  virus”  is  being  traded  on  the  black  market  and  “could  be  used  by  terrorists”.  That,  we 
suppose,  would  be  the  bad  guys  as  opposed  to  the  saintly  individuals  who  originally  put  Stuxnet 
together, very possibly to attack nuclear facilities. 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

Our view is that, given the amount of detailed analysis that’s already available, anyone with malicious 
intent and a smidgen of technical skill would not need the original code. 

There  is  certainly  substantial  evidence  suggesting    that  equipment  used  for  uranium  enrichment  in 
nuclear facilities, perhaps in Iran, was the original target. However, Will Gilpin, apparently an IT security 
consultant  to  the  UK  government,  suggested  that  possession  of  “the  virus”  in  whatever  form  has 
alarming potential: 

 

 

“You could shut down the police 999 system. 
“You could shut down hospital systems and equipment.” 
“You could shut down power stations, you could shut down the transport network across the 

 
United Kingdom.” 

These assertions clearly owed little to the PLC code actually discussed in the competent analyses above. 
While it might be possible to do all these things, that would require extensive re-engineering of the 
existing code and possibly a completely new set of 0-days. 

While it’s by no means all-inclusive, the timeline at http://www.infracritical.com/papers/stuxnet-
timeline.txt is pretty comprehensive. 

 

The Langner team at http://www.langner.com/en/2010/12/31/year-end-roundup/ finished the year 
2010 with a blog summarizing the “up-to-date bottom line” on their view of Stuxnet. Of course, they 
had published a steady stream of interesting and relevant blogs at http://www.langner.com/en/blog/ 
before that, some of which have been listed in this document. 

As of version 1.31 of this document, we will not be publishing further revisions except to correct errors 
or to introduce substantial new or modified material. We will, however, be adding links from time to 
time to the ESET blog entry at http://blog.eset.com/?p=5731.

Distribution 

24 

 

In this section we present information about the ways in which Stuxnet self-propagates. We pay close 
attention  to  the  vulnerabilities  used  by  the  worm  to  propagate  itself  and  describe  it  in  details  in  this 
section.  The  reader  can  find  comprehensive  information  here  on  the  LNK  vulnerability  and  its 
implementation  in  Stuxnet  as  well  as  on  the  MS10-061 vulnerability  in  the  Windows  Spooler,  both of 
which are used to deliver and execute the malware’s binaries on a remote machine. We also describe 
vulnerabilities in win32k.sys driver and Windows Task Scheduler Service implementation used to elevate 
Stuxnet’s privileges up to SYSTEM level. 

There are four ways the rootkit can distribute itself: by means of flash drives, through network shares, 
through  an  RPC  vulnerability  and  through  the  recently  patched  MS10-061  Print  Spooler  vulnerability. 
The figure below depicts the vulnerabilities used for propagation and installation.

3.1  The LNK exploit 

Microsoft Security Advisory (2286198) CVE-2010-2568 includes links to detailed information about this 
exploit. http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx. ESET allocated a separate 
detection  family  LNK/Autostart  for  the  detection  of  attacks  using  this  vulnerability.  This  vulnerability 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

was known to be in the wild for over a month even after it was identified before Microsoft were able to 
release a patch for it in late August 2010, as described in the following bulletin:  

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-046.mspx.  

The vulnerability is not based on a standard means of exploitation, where you would expect to need to 
prepare  exploit  with  shellcode,  which  would  make  use  of  the  vulnerability.  In  fact  any  .LNK  file  can 
exploit it, at exploitation CVE-2010-2568 is used feature .LNK files, when displayed in windows explorer 
and the icon for a .LNK file is loaded from a CPL file (Windows Control Panel file). Actually, the CPL file 
represents a conventional dynamic link library and this is the crux of the vulnerability. The role of the 
payload module will be indicated in the path to the CPL file. 

 

Figure 3.2 – Information about CPL File 

 

So  below  we  can  see  the  general  scheme  of  the  Shell  Link  (.  LNK)  Binary  File  Format 
(http://www.stdlib.com/art6-Shortcut-File-Format-lnk.html). 

Figure 3.3 – Scheme of Shell Link (.LNK) Binary File Format 

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com                                                                                         

 

26 

The most interesting feature here is hidden in the File Location Info field, which specifies the path from 
which the CPL file should be loaded. A vulnerability was found in Windows Shell which could allow code 
execution if the icon of a specially crafted shortcut is merely displayed. Here is a malicious .LNK file from 
an infected USB flash drive: 

 

Figure 3.4 – Malware .LNK File from an Infected USB Flash Drive 

 

In  the  File  Location  Info  field  there  is  a  path  to  the  file  that  contains  the  payload  that  should  be 
executed. In this case, the path points to an external drive, and when this is viewed in Windows Explorer 
it causes the system to execute ~wtr4141.tmp. More information on the distribution using external USB 
and media devices can be read in the section devoted to precisely this functionality. 

In  all  the  analyzed  malicious  .LNK  files  we  have  seen,  there  is  a  feature  that  consists  of  two  GUID 
sequences. These sequences indicate the following: 

Figure 3.5 – GUID from .LNK Files 

 

The .LNK file most likely points to and loads a CPL file. When the directory containing the crafted .LNK 
exploit is opened with Windows Explorer, the following chain of function calls will eventually lead to a 
function  call  LoadLibraryW().  When  the  function  LoadLibraryW()  is  called,  the  malware  DLL    will  be 
executed. 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com                                                                                         

 

27 

Figure 3.6 – A Chain of Calls 

 

If we trace this chain of calls in the debugger, we see confirmation of all the facts described above. Thus 
we  can  execute  any  malicious  module,  as  LoadLibraryW()  receives  as  a  parameter  the  path  to  the 
module, which it must perform and no additional inspections are not happening. 

 

Figure 3.7 –Loading Malicious Module 

 

This  vulnerability  highlights  the  fact  that  like  many  other  bugs,  this  error  has  found  its  way  into  the 
architecture of fundamental mechanisms, in this case for processing LNK files. Vulnerabilities which, as 
in  this  case,  are  symptomatic  of  fundamental  design  flaws  are  a  nightmare  for  developers  of  any 
program, because they are always difficult and time-consuming to fix.  

3.1.1  Propagation via External Storage Devices 

Since the vulnerability is based on the mechanism  for the display .LNK files, it is possible to distribute 
malware via removable media and USB drives without using Autorun-related infection. This propagation 
vector was used in the Stuxnet attack. 

3.1.2  Metasploit and WebDAV Exploit 

including 

implementation  of  the  exploit 

A  few  days  after  the  public  debate  concerning  .LNK  PoC  exploitation,  the  Metasploit  Framework 
released  code 
in  order  to  allow  remote  attacks 
(http://www.metasploit.com/modules/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_046_shortcut_icon_dllloader), 
Prior to the  release of this exploit,  it was  believed that this vulnerability is  not exploitable  for  remote 
attacks. Researchers from the Metasploit Project showed that this was not the case, by using the UNC 
path  to  the  WebDAV  service  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc227098(PROT.10).aspx).  This 
vulnerability  is  still  functional.  This  exploit  used  a  WebDAV  service  that  can  be  used  to  execute  an 
arbitrary  payload  when  accessed  as  a  UNC  path  by  following  the  link  generated  by  Metasploit  that 
displays the directory containing .LNK file and DLL module with payload. 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

The .LNK file contains the network path to the module with the payload.

The vulnerability in .LNK files and the recently discovered DLL Hijacking vulnerability 
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2269637.mspx) have much in common, both in 
the nature of their appearance, and in the ways in which they’ve been exploited. 

 

3.1.3  What Do DLL Hijacking Flaws and the LNK Exploit have in Common? 

While  we  have  been  writing  this  report  public  information  was  released  about  DLL  Hijacking  flaws 
(Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637) and we noted some association with or resemblance to the .LNK 
files  vulnerability.  Both  vulnerabilities  are  inherent  design  flaws  and  in  both  cases  the  function 
LoadLibrary() is used. The directory where the exploitative file is found can be situated in a USB drive, an 
extracted archive, or a remote network share. In both cases we find spoofed paths to a loadable module 
and the possibility of a remote attack via the WebDAV service.  

What  other  vulnerabilities  are  stored  in  Windows  operating  systems,  nobody  knows.  Most  likely,  this 
vector  of  attack  will  undergo  a  thorough  research  and  it  might  be  that  something  else  equally 
interesting is awaiting us in the near future.

3.2  LNK Vulnerability in Stuxnet 

29 

This is the first way in which the rootkit distributes itself. When you inspect a flash USB drive infected 
with the Stuxnet worm you can expect to find 6 files there as on the following screenshot: 

Figure 3.10 – The Worm’s Files on a USB Flash Drive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; 
Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; 
Copy of Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; 
Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; 
~WTR4141.TMP; 
~WTR4132.TMP. 

The first four files are LNK files  – these are the files that specify how the Icon of other files should be 
displayed. The files with LNK extension are different: here is an example of the contents of one of them: 

 

Figure 3.11 – Contents of the .LNK Files 

 

The worm exploits the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability (see section The LNK exploit for details) to infect the 
system.  You can see  in the  figure  above  the highlighted name of the module to be  loaded during the 
exploitation  of  the  vulnerability.  When  a  user  tries  to  open  an  infected  USB  flash  drive  with  an 
application that can display icons for shortcuts, the file with the name ~WTR4141.TMP is loaded and its 
entry  point  is  called.  The  file  is,  in  fact,  a  dynamic  link  library,  the  main  purpose  of  which  is  to  load 
another file with the name ~WTR4132.TMP from the infected flash drive.  
 

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

The files with the .LNK filename extension are essentially the same except they specify different paths to 
the single file: 

\\.\STORAGE#Volume#_??_USBSTOR#Disk&Ven_____USB&Prod_FLASH_DRIVE&Rev_#1

\\.\STORAGE#Volume#1&19f7e59c&0&_??_USBSTOR#Disk&Ven_____USB&Prod_FLASH

\\.\STORAGE#RemovableMedia#7&1c5235dc&0&RM#{53f5630d-b6bf-11d0-94f2-

All these strings specify a path to the file located on the removable drive, and are used instead of a short 
form of the path with a drive letter. The first part of the path to the file (before the backslash "\" that 
precedes the filename) is a symbolic link name referring to the corresponding volume, as we can see on 
the figure below: 

Figure 3.12 – Symbolic Link Names of Volumes 

 

 

The  first  entry  in  figure  3.12  corresponds  to  the  volume  representing  a  USB  flash  drive,  the  name  of 
which is \Device\HarddiskVolume5. Notably, that drive letters are symbolic link names too that refer to 
the same device objects:  

Figure 3.13 – Drive letters 

 

Stuxnet uses the long versions of pathnames because it is impossible to predict what letter corresponds 
to a removable drive  in a remote  system, and as a result,  the short  paths are  likely to  be  incorrect  in 
some cases. The longer variant of a path is constructed with respect to certain rules and configuration 
information  obtained  from  the  hardware,  so  that  we  can  predict  with  considerable  accuracy  what 
symbolic link name corresponds to a device on a remote machine. 

The  rules  according  to  which  these  symbolic  links  are  constructed  vary  depending  on  the  operating 
system,  which  is  why  Stuxnet  uses  four  distinct  .LNK  files.  For  instance,  the  first  entry  in  the  list 
presented above won't work on Windows XP but will work on Windows 7, the second entry works on 
Windows  Vista,  while  the  last  two  entries  work  on  Windows  XP,  Windows  Server  2003  and  Windows 
2000.

3.3  The MS10-061 Attack Vector 

31 

Another  way  in  which  the  worm  replicates  itself  over  the  network  exploits  a  vulnerability  in  Window 
Spooler (MS10-061). Machines with file and printer sharing turned on are vulnerable to the attack. This 
vulnerability results in privilege escalation allowing a remote  user using a Guest  account  to  write  into 
%SYSTEM% directory of the target machine.  

The attack is performed in two stages: during the first stage the worm copies the dropper and additional 
file into Windows\System32\winsta.exe and Windows\System32\wbem\mof\sysnullevnt.mof 
respectively, while at the second stage the dropper is executed. 

The  first  stage  exploits  the  MS10-061  vulnerability.  Under  certain  conditions  the  spooler  improperly 
impersonates a client that sends two “documents” for printing as we can see on the figure below.  

Figure 3.14 – "Printing" Malicious Files into Files in %SYSTEM% Directory 

 

 
These  documents  are  “printed”  to  files  in  the  %SYSTEM%  directory  while  a  user  has  Guest 
privileges  that  shouldn’t  entail  access  rights  to  the  %SYSTEM%  directory.  During  exploitation  of  the 
vulnerability, a thread of the process spoolsv.exe calls an API function StartDocPrinter() with parameter 
specifying the following information about document to be printed: 

 

 

typedef struct _DOC_INFO_1 {  

 

 

 

LPTSTR pDocName; 

 

LPTSTR pOutputFile;   

LPTSTR pDatatype; 

 

 

 

 

} DOC_INFO_1; 

// Default

In the middle of September 2010, Microsoft released a security patch to fix MS10-061. We have 
compared the original executable spoolsv.exe with the patched executable and found some functional 
differences.  One  of  the  most  important  differences  concerns  the  YStartDocPrinter  function  which  is 
eventually  called  in  order  to  print  a  document.  On  the  figure  below  we  provide  a  graphical 
representation of the functions.

The left-hand side represents the patched function while on the right-hand the original is displayed. The 
functions  are  in  general  the  same,  but  some  additional  checks  have  been  added,  and  these  are 
highlighted in red. Before printing a document the function performs the following checks: 

 

whether the caller belongs to Local group; 
whether OutputFile parameter is NULL or equal to a port name of the printer: otherwise 

 
a client needs to have appropriate access rights to write to the specified file. 

The sequence of check is presented on the figure below.

The second stage of the attack employs the file wbem\mof\sysnullevnt.mof : that is, a Managed Object 
Format file. Files of this type are used to create or register providers, events, and event categories for 
WMI. Under certain conditions this file  runs  winsta.exe  (the  dropper)  and its execution by the system 
results in the infection of the system.

3.4  Network Shared Folders And RPC Vulnerability (MS08-067) 

34 

The worm is also capable of distributing itself over the network through shared folders. It scans network 
shares  c$  and  admin$  on  the  remote  computers  and  installs  a  file  (dropper)  there  with  the  name 
DEFRAG<GetTickCount>.TMP, and schedules a task to be executed on the next day: 

rundll.exe "C:\addins\DEFRAGdc2d0.TMP", DllGetClassObject 

 

Figure 3.17 – Stuxnet Schedules Dropper Execution on the Next Day 

 

Stuxnet’s  exploitation  of  the  MS08-67  vulnerability  to  propagate  itself  through  the  network  is 
comparable  to  the  use  of  the  same  vulnerability  by  the  network  worm  Conficker.  Its  exploit  is 
implemented as a separate module. We have compared the two exploit implementations in Conficker 
and  Stuxnet  and  found  that  the  shell  codes  that  have  been  used  are  different.  Stuxnet's  shell  code  is 
rather sophisticated and employs advanced techniques that have recently become widely spread such 
as ROP (return oriented programming).

3.5  0-day in Win32k.sys (MS10-073) 

35 

When the Win32/Stuxnet worm didn’t have enough privileges to install itself in the system it exploited a 
recently  patched  (MS10-73)  0-day  vulnerability  in  the  win32k.sys  system  module  to  escalate  privilege 
level up to SYSTEM, which enabled it to perform any tasks it likes on the local machine. The vulnerable 
systems are: 

  Microsoft Windows 2000; 
  Unpatched Windows XP (all service packs). 

 

Actually, in theory, it is possible to exploit this vulnerability on the other systems as the code pertaining 
to the vulnerability exists (see figure 3.17), but there are no known ways to reach it (i. e. the code that 
transfers control to the shell code) and as a result the shell code won't be executed. 

 

To perform this trick, Stuxnet loads a specially crafted keyboard layout file, making it possible to execute 
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The escalation of privileges occurs while dispatching input from 
the  keyboard 
input  from  the  keyboard  using  the 
NtUserSendInput system service, the following code is executed: 

in  Win32k.sys  module.  While  processing 

 

Figure 3.18 – A fragment of the executed code during processing keyboard input 

 

The  purpose  of  this  code  is  to  determine  how  to  dispatch  virtual  key  code  of  the  pressed  button. 
Register ecx specifies the type of the handler according to the current keyboard layout to be called in 
_aNLSVKProc procedure table. This table consists of three handlers: 

Figure 3.19 – _aNLSVKProc procedure table 

 

As  we  can  see  from  the  figure  above  (3.18),  the  _aNLSVKProc  is  followed  by  3  DWORDs,  the  last  of 
which  (highlighted  in  red)  can  be  interpreted  as  a  pointer  pointing  to    0x60636261  in  the  user-mode 
address space. Thus, if we set the ecx register in the code in figure 1 with the proper value, namely 5, 
then we can execute code at  0x6036261 with SYSTEM privileges. 

We  can  manipulate  the  ecx  register  in  this  code  by  loading  a  specially  crafted  keyboard  layout  file 
specifying that certain virtual key codes should call the procedure indexed as 5. The keyboard layout file 
is a dynamic link library of which the .data section is specially structured. Below we present a structure 
that maps virtual keys to corresponding procedures in the table. 

 

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

VK_FPARAM NLSFEProcAlt[8]; 

} VK_F, *KBD_LONG_POINTER PVK_F; 

The worm loads a special keyboard layout file by calling NtUserLoadKeyboardLayoutEx and passing it the 
following hexadecimal constant 0x01AE0160 as an offTable parameter. The low word of this parameter 
specifies the RVA (Relative Virtual Address) of the KBDTABLES structure from the beginning of the file, 
while  the  high  word  specifies  the  RVA  of  KBDNLSTABLES,  which  is  of  particular  interest.  The  latter 
structure determines the address and size of the array of VK_F structures contained in the file. 

typedef struct tagKbdNlsLayer {

// RVA of array of VK_F structures in the

USHORT *KBD_LONG_POINTER pusMouseVKey; 

} KBDNLSTABLES, *KBD_LONG_POINTER PKBDNLSTABLES; 

In figure 3.19 below we present the contents of the .data section where we can see that the structure 
KBDNLSTABLES located at RVA 0x1AE specifies one structure VK_F located at RVA 0x01C2. 

Figure 3.20 – .data section of the crafted keyboard layout file 

 

As we can see, the keyboard layout file contains exactly one VK_F structure that maps a virtual-key with 
code equal to procedure 0 in _aNLSVKProc with indexed as 5.

One thing we need to do in order to exploit this vulnerability is to allocate a buffer for the code to be 
executed  at  address  0x60636261  as  in  the  case  with  Stuxnet,  which  allocates  32KB  of  memory  at 
0x60630000 (figure 3.20) and writes shell code at 0x60636261 (figure 3.21):

Microsoft's patch 

On  the  13th  of  October  2010  Microsoft  released  a  security  patch  that  fixes  this  vulnerability.  We've 
compared  unpatched  and  patched  Win32k.sys  modules  to  understand  the  way  the  vulnerability  was 
fixed. As we expected MS added an additional check in the code handling keyboard input (namely in the 
function  xxxEKNLSProcs)  to  prevent  NLSFEProcType  field  of  the  VK_F  structure  of  being  out  of  the 
boundaries  _aNLSVKProc  table.  In  the  figures  below  we  can  see  unpatched  (figure  3.22)  and  patched 
code (figure 3.23) respectively where the additional check is highlighted with the red border. 

As  we  can  see,  before  calling  a  procedure  from  _aNLSVKProc  table  the  check  is  performed  to  ensure 
that the index of the procedure doesn't exceed the value of 2 (correct values are 0,1,2).

3.6  MS10-092: Exploiting a 0-day in Task Scheduler  

40 

Yet another vulnerability that Stuxnet exploits in order to elevate privileges concerns the Task Scheduler 
Service implemented in Windows operating systems starting from Windows Vista. Remarkably enough, 
64-bit  version  of  the  operating  systems  are  vulnerable  as  well  as  x86  versions.  Exploiation  of  the 
vulnerability allows Stuxnet to elevate its privileges up to SYSTEM level. 

There vulnerability represented a serious flaw in the original design of the service: namely in the way it 
controlled  integrity  of  the  metadata  describing  scheduled  jobs.  In  operating  systems  after  Windows 
Vista, Task Scheduler creates an xml file with configuration information for each registered  job. These 
files  are  usually  located  in  the  %SystemRoot%\system32\Tasks  folder  (if  not  otherwise  specified)  and 
contain  such  information  as  type  of  the  job,  path  to  the  executable  and  command  line  arguments, 
account that the executable will be run under, required privileges and so on.  

 

Figure  3.25 – A part of the configuration file describing a job 

 

In the figure above you can see part of the configuration xml file for a task. The Principals section in the 
file defines required privileges for the job, while the Actions section defines what the job should do (to 
get the full list of possible job actions we refer the reader to MSDN). In particular case as described in 
figure  3.25  the  job  will  run  the  notepad  application  with  no  command  line  arguments,  using  the 
LocalSystem account with the highest available privileges. 

Although  the  Task  Scheduler  directory  can  be  read  only  by  LocalSystem  and  members  of  the  local 
administrators group, the file describing the task scheduled by a user is fully accessible to him as long as 
he  isn’t  a  Guest(  as  can  be  seen  on  the  following  figure  3.26).  To  protect  the  integrity  of  the  job 
configuration  files  and  prevent  users  from  modifying  them  (for  instance  to  elevate  privileges  by 
overwriting the Principals section), Task Scheduler calculates a checksum on creating a task.  When it is 
time  to  start  the  job,  Task  Scheduler  recalculates  it and  compares  the  new  check  sum  to  the  original 
value: if they match the job is run. 

The flaw in the aforementioned scenario is that Task Scheduler calculates the checksum with the CRC32 
algorithm  (you  can  find  a  description  of  the  algorithm  in  Appendix  D).  This  is  known  to  be  good  for 
detecting unintentional errors (mainly  due to transmitting data through communication channels)  but 
not intentional as in the case. It is known also that the CRC32 algorithm has linear properties that make 
it very easy to create another message with the same checksum as the specified message.  

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

Figure  3.26 – Access permissions to the Task folder and a task file 

 

This is exactly what Stuxnet does in order to elevate its privileges in unpatched Vista and later operating 
systems. Here is a brief summary of the algorithm that Stuxnet uses to exploit the vulnerability: 

Create  a  job  that  will  be  run  under  the  current  user  account  with  the  least  available 

1. 
privileges; 
2. 
its CRC32 checksum; 
3. 
matches the same check sum as the original file  and set the following properties:

Modify the task configuration file corresponding to the task created at step 1 so that it

d.  Actions  Context=LocalSystem  (security  context  under  which  the  actions  of  the 
task are performed); 

4.  Run the task. 

To  ensure  that  the  modified  file  has  the  same  check  sum  value  as  the  original,  it  appends  a  special 
comment of the form <!--XY--> to the end of the file and calculates XY (the algorithm for calculating this

such manipulations is as shown in figure 3.27: 

Figure  3.27 – Forged task configuration file 

 

As a result Task Scheduler will start the task normally with the specified privileges.  

Microsoft's patch 

On the 14th of December 2010 Microsoft released a security update (MS10-092) to fix the vulnerability 
in Windows Task Scheduler service which allows elevation of privilege, as described above. To protect 
the integrity of the xml schema describing a task, the service already used the crc-32 algorithm. Thus, 
given a task xml schema, it is possible to create another schema with the same checksum. 

 

To fix the vulnerability Microsoft implemented an additional SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm to 
check  the  integrity  of  a  task  xml  schema.  If  we  look  into  the  updated  schedsvc.dll  library  which 
implements the service, we can find a type HashCompute which is not present in the unpatched library: 

Figure 3.28 - Available methods of the HashCompute type 

 

The type was implemented to provide integrity checking for the xml schemas that define tasks. Here are 
cross-references  to  the  HashCompute::ComputeHash  method  which  tell  us  when  the  hash  value  is 
calculated and when it is checked: 

Figure 3.29 - Cross-references to HashCompute::ComputeHash method 

 

If we look at the implementation of the HashCompute::ComputeHash method, the following code can be 
found, which calculates hash value of the xml schema: 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

Figure 3.31 - Computing SHA-256 of xml schema 

The SHA-256 hash function is known to be secure against finding the second pre-image and collisions, 
unlike the  crc-32 checksum algorithm. Thus given an xml schema that define  a task it is impossible in 
polynomial (real) time to construct another xml schema with the same hash value. This means that it is 
no  longer  possible  to  exploit  the  vulnerability  on  a  patched  system  in  the  way  that  Win32/Stuxnet 
attempts. 

MS10-092 in Win32/Olmarik 

A  new  modification  of  the  notorious  rootkit  Win32/Olmarik.AIY,  also  known  as  TDL4  (you  can  read 
"TDL3:  The  Rootkit  of  All  Evil?"  report  for  detailed  information  about  previous  version  of  the  rootkit) 
appeared  in  the  end  of  November  which  is  capable  of  elevating  privileges  on  Microsoft  Windows 
operating systems starting from Windows Vista by means of exploiting the MS10-092 vulnerability.  

TDL4's implementation of the code that exploits the vulnerability doesn't essentially differ from that of 
Stuxnet's code. The rootkit creates a legitimate task by means of the available interface in the system, 
then reads the xml schema corresponding to the task directly from the file in the Task Scheduler folder, 
and then modifies it: 

Fig. 3.32: Modification of xml Schema 

 

It sets certain attributes with the following values: 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

  Principal Id=LocalSystem ; 
  UserId=S-1-5-18; 
  RunLevel=HighestAvailable; 
  Actions Context=LocalSystem;  

 As  a  result  the  rootkit  creates  an  xml  schema  defining  a  task  that  will  be  run under  the  LocalSystem 
account. Below you can see a part of the schema:

Stuxnet Implementation 

 

This chapter covers the implementation aspects of the worm: namely, its user-mode and kernel-mode 
components. A full set of the modules it incorporates can be found in table 4.1.2. The first part of the 
section  describes  Stuxnet’s  user-mode  functionality  and  starts  with  an  overview  of  the  main  module. 
Furthermore, we present information on how Stuxnet injects code into processes in the system, and on 
its installation algorithm. We also describe the set of functions exported by the main module, and the 
RPC  server  used  for  P2P  communication.  The  second  part  of  this  section  concerns  the  kernel-mode 
drivers that Stuxnet uses to hide its dropper and malicious .LNK files, and inject code into processes so 
as  to  survive  after  reboot.  We  also  present  some  information  on  Stuxnet  configuration  data  and  its 
remote communication protocol with C&C servers. 

4.1  User-mode functionality 

There are several modules that constitute the user-mode functionality. The main module that contains 
the others is a large dynamic link library. Other modules including kernel mode drivers are stored in the 
DLL’s resources. 

4.1.1  Overview of the main module 

 

The  main  module  is  represented  as  a  large  DLL  packed  with  UPX.  Its  unpacked  size  is  1233920  bytes 
(1.18 MB).

The main module exports 21 functions by ordinal. Each function has its own purpose as will be described 
in the section Exported functions.

4.1.2 

Injecting code 

The malware employs quite an interesting technique to inject code into the address space of a process 
and execute exported functions. The user-mode modules of Stuxnet are implemented as dynamic link 
libraries, and exported functions are frequently executed or injected into the address space of a process. 
There are two different cases: when a module is loaded into an existing process, or when the module is 
injected into a new process.  

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com                                                                                         

 
Injecting into a current process 

4.1.3 

47 

Consider the  first  case, when one of the user-mode components  wants to call a function exported by 
another component in the context of the calling process. To avoid being detected by antivirus software 
the malware loads a module in the following way: 

1. 
2. 

It allocates a memory buffer in the calling process for the module to be loaded; 
It patches Ntdll.dll system library: namely, it hooks the following functions: 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 
f. 
It  calls  LoadLibraryW  API,  exported  from  kerenl32.dll  and  passing  it  as  a  parameter  a 
library  name,  using  the  pattern:  KERNEL32.DLL.ASLR.XXXXXXXX  or 

ZwMapViewOfSection; 
ZwCreateSection; 
ZwOpenFile; 
ZwClose; 
ZwQueryAttributesFile; 
ZwQuerySection; 

3. 
specially  constructed 
SHELL32.DLL.ASLR.XXXXXXXX, where XXXXXXXX is a random hexadecimal number; 
4. 
5. 

It calls desired exported function; 
It calls FreeLibrary API function to free loaded library. 

To  hook  the  functions  specified  above,  the  malware  allocates  a  memory  buffer  for  code  that  will 
dispatch calls to hooked functions, overwrite some data in MZ header of the image with the code that 
transfers  control  to  the  new  functions,  and  hook  the  original  functions  by  overwriting  its  bodies,  the 
result of these manipulations is presented on figure 4.4.  

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com                                                                                         

 

The MZ header of ntdll.dll is overwritten with the following code: 

49 

 

Figure 4.5 – Code Injected into MZ Header of ntdll.dll 

 

The purpose of all these manipulations is to load a non-existent library legitimately (at least as far as the 
system is concerned). The hook functions allow the malware to load module as if it were a library that 
really  existed.  When  a  library  with  specific  name  (KERNEL32.DLL.ASLR  or  SHELL32.DLL.ASLR)  is 
requested, these functions map the desired module into the address space of the process. As a result, 
the loaded module looks like a real dynamic link library except that there is no file with the name of the 
library on the hard drive, which reduces probability of detection by heuristic methods. Some anti-rootkit 
software does detect it and warn users: 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

4.1.4 

Injecting into a new process 

 

In the second case when the malware requires the module to be executed in a newly created process it 
uses different approach. To achieve this Stuxnet: 

Creates a host process; 
1. 
2. 
Replaces the image of the process with the module to execute and with supplemental 
code that will load the module and call specified export passing parameters (as in the first case 
described). 

 

Depending on the processes present in the system the malware chooses the host process from 

 
the following list: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lssas.exe (system process); 
avp.exe (Kaspersky); 
mcshield.exe (McAfee VirusScan); 
avguard.exe (AntiVir Personal Edition); 
bdagent.exe (BitDefender Switch Agent); 
UmxCfg.exe (eTrust Configuration Engine from Computer Associates International); 
fsdfwd.exe (F-Secure Anti-Virus suite); 
rtvscan.exe (Symantec Real Time Virus Scan service); 
ccSvcHst.exe (Symantec Service Framework); 
ekrn.exe (ESET Antivirus Service Process); 
tmproxy.exe (PC-cillin antivirus software from TrendMicro); 

The  malware  enumerates  processes  in  the  system  and  if  it  finds  a  process  whose  executable 
  
image has a name present in this list, and which meets certain criteria, then it is chosen to be a host for 
the module. 

 

4.1.5 

Installation 

We can consider the case when ~WTR4141. TMP is loaded due to the vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568) in 
displaying  shortcuts  for  icons  as  described  in  section  1.6.  As  soon  as  the  file  is  loaded  it  hooks  the 
following functions to hide the worm's files on a flash USB drive. 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com                                                                                         

51 

 
In kernel32.dll: 

 

o  FindFirstFileW; 
o  FindNextFileW; 
o  FindFirstFileExW; 

 

In ntdll.dll: 

o  NtQueryDirectoryFile; 
o  ZwQueryDirectoryFile. 

This function filters the files that satisfy the following criteria from being displayed: 

 

files with ".LNK" extension of which the file size is equal to 1471 (0x104b) bytes; 
files  with  ".TMP"  extension  of  which  the  name  consists  of  12  characters  (including  filename 
 
extension)  in  the  following  format:  "~WTRabcd.TMP",  where  a,b,c,d  are  digits  from  0  to  9  which 
sum modulo 10 equals 0 ("~WTR4411.TMP" for example).  

This  module  loads  another  module.  ~WTR4132.TMP,  using  a  method  described  in  previous 
 
section.  ~WTR4132.TMP  extracts  from  its  section  with  ".stub"  name  another  component  –  the  main 
dynamic link library of Stuxnet - then loads it and calls exported function number 15.

This  function  checks  whether  the  token  of  the  current  user  belongs  to  the  group  of  the  local 
administrators  on  the  computer:  if  so,  it  executes  the  exported  function  with  ordinal  0x10  in  a  new 
process. This function installs Stuxnet's components onto the system.

This function builds Stuxnet's dropper  from the files located in the system and runs it. The  dropper  is 
constructed from the following files which seems to be a components of Stuxnet: 

 

 

 

%Dir%\XUTILS\listen\XR000000.MDX; 
%Dir%\XUTILS\links\S7P00001.DBF; 
%Dir%\XUTILS\listen\S7000001.MDX. 

%Dir% passed as a parameter by a caller of the function. 

Export 10 

This  function  performs  the  same  actions  as  function  number  9  which  builds  and  runs  the  Stuxnet 
dropper. The only difference between these functions is that  this function can build the dropper from 
the set of the files used in function number 9 as well as from the following files: 

 

 

 

%Dir%\GracS\cc_alg.sav; 
%Dir%\GracS\\db_log.sav;

This  function  replaces  s7otbxdx.dll  with  a malicious DLL.  It moves  the  original library  into  a  file  called 
s7otbxdsx.dll. The malicious library is a wrapper for the original DLL: that is, it simply passes control to 
the original library, except in the case of certain functions which it hooks:

This function exchanges information with the C&C server. It creates and sends the message to the C&C 
server as described in the section Remote Communication Protocol. When the message is ready it scans 
processes in the system to find iexplore.exe. If this exists then it injects the main module into it and calls 
export  function  29,  passing  the  message  as  a  parameter.  This  function  is  responsible  for  performing 
actual data  exchange with the  C&C  server.  In the event that there  is no iexplore.exe in the system, it 
calls this function from the address space of the default browser: it starts the default browser as a new 
process, injects into it the main module, and calls the function performing data exchange.

This  function  is  called  from  the  services.exe  process:  otherwise,  it  won't  be  executed.  This  function 
starts  the  RPC  server  to  handle  RPC  calls  made  by  Stuxnet's  user-mode  components  and  creates  a 
window that drops malicious files onto removable drives.  

It  registers  a  window  class  with  the  name  "  AFX64c313"  and  creates  a  window  corresponding  to  the 
class created. The window procedure of the class monitors WM_DEVICE_CHANGE messages sent when 
there is a change to the hardware configuration of a device or the computer. The window procedure of 
the class handles only requests with wParam set to DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL. These are sent when a device 
or  removable media  have  been  inserted  and  have  become  accessible  (for  instance,  when  a  USB  flash 
drive  has  been  connected  to  the  computer).  When  this  happens,  depending  on  parameters  of  the 
configuration  data,  it  can  either  drop  malicious  files  on  the  drive,  or  remove  them  from  there. 
Moreover, configuration data also specify the minimum number of files that the removable drive should 
contain in order to perform infection. 

4.1.7  RPC Server  

Stuxnet implements an RPC server to communicate with other instances of the worm over the network. 
It  uses  the  RPC  mechanism  to  receive  updates  not  only  from  the  remote  C&C  server  but  from  other 
instances of the worm running on the infected machines in the network. This feature adds flexibility as it 
is able to stay updated even without direct connection with C&C server. It requests the version of the 
worm installed on the remote machine, and if the remote machine is running a more recent version, the 
newer version is requested and installed on the requester machine. The following figure illustrates the 
architecture of the server:

Figure 4.9 – Architecture of Stuxnet's RPC Server 

 

It consists of the two components: 

 

The first component is responsible for handling RPC calls from the local host, i.e. from 
 
modules injected into process within the local system. It is executed within the address space of 
the services.exe process; 
 The  second  component  of  the  server  performs  handling  RPC  calls  from  remote  hosts. 
 
This  component  is  executed  within  the  address  space  of  the  process  hosting  one  of  the 
following services: netsvc, rpcss, browser. 

Both components implement the same functions. The first five function as outlined on the figure above 
are  executed  by  local  component  only:  when  these  functions  are  executed  they  determine  which 
component calls them, and if it is the component responsible for handling remote calls, they make a call 
to  the  local  component  and  exit.  This  is  indicated  in  the  figure  with  arrows.  Stuxnet's  RPC  Server 
implements the following procedures: 

RpcProc1 – Returns the version of the worm; 
RpcProc2  –  Loads  a  module  passed  as  a  parameter  into  a  new  process  and  executes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
specified exported function; 
 
executing this function and calls its exported function number 1; 
 

RpcProc3  –  Loads  a  module  passed  as  a  parameter  into  the  address  of  the  process 

RpcProc4 – Loads a module passed as a parameter into a new process and executes it; 
RpcProc5 – Builds the worm dropper; 
RpcProc6 – Runs the specified application; 
RpcProc7 – Reads data from the specified file; 
RpcProc8 – Writes data into the specified file; 
RpcProc9 – Deletes the specified file; 
RpcProc10 – Works with the files of which the names are intercepted by hooks set up in 

 
function number 2 and writes information in tracing file. 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

4.2  Kernel-mode functionality  

The  worm  has  some  rootkit  functionality,  as  during  infection  of  the  system  it  drops  and  installs  two 
kernel-mode drivers that allow it to hide files and inject code into process in the system: 

  MrxCls.sys; 
  MrxNet.sys. 

These modules are not packed or protected with any packer or protector. Moreover these drivers are 
digitally signed. Here are the digital certificates of the public keys corresponding to the private keys used 
to sign the drivers (we received samples signed with two different private keys).

4.2.1  MRXCLS.sys  

4.2.1.1 Encrypted data 

60 

This  driver  is  designated  to  inject  code  into  the  address  space  of  the  processes  in  the  system.  It  is 
registered  in  OS  as  a  boot  start  service.  Thus  it  is  loaded  as  early  as  possible  in  the  OS  boot  process. 
Some  of  its  data  are  encrypted  with  a  custom  encryption  algorithm.  If  we  decrypt  them,  we  get  the 
following string constants with the following meanings: 

 

Table 4.2.1 – Decrypted String Constants Found in the Driver

\Device\MrxClsDvx 

Name of the registry key that 

corresponds to the driver 

Name of the value of the registry 

key related to the driver  

Name of the device object that is 

created by the driver 

To  be  able  to  inject  code  it  registers  a  special  routine  that  is  called  each  time  a  module  is  loaded  in 
address space of a process by calling API function PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine.  

4.2.1.2 Configuration data 

 

The driver holds configuration data that specify in which processes the code is to be injected. The data 
are stored in driver's registry key with the value  name  presented in Table  4.2.1. The data can also be 
stored in a file on disk: if the driver failed for some reason to read the configuration data from registry, it 
reads it from the file, if any exists. Here is configuration data found on an infected machine: 

Figure 4.12 – The configuration data of the driver 

 

As we can see from the figure, these data specify what modules should be injected by the driver into the 
address  spaces of certain processes. For instance,  here we see that in processes  in which executables 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com                                                                                         

 

61 

have the names services.exe, S7tgtopx.exe and CCProjectMgr.exe, the driver injects a module stored in 
a  file  with  the  name  \SystemRoot\inf\oem7A.PNF.  The  configuration  data  also  specify  the  name  or 
ordinal  number  of  the  export  of  the  injected  module  to  be  called.  For  instance  in  this  case,  when 
oem7A.PNF  will  be  loaded  into  the  address  spaces  of  the  CCProjectMgr.exe  or  S7togtopx.exe,  the 
exported function number 2 should be called. In the case of services.exe the exported function with the 
ordinal  1  should  be  called.  If  a  process  is  debugged  the  driver  doesn't  perform  an  injection,  and  it 
determines  whether  the  process  is  debugged  by  reading  BeingDebugged  field  of  the  PEB  structure 
related to the process.  

4.2.1.3 Injector 

Here we briefly describe the injector. It is not only capable of injecting modules into the address space 
of a process but is also able to stealthily call an exported function from the already injected modules. 
The injection of a module is performed in three stages: 

Allocating memory in the address space of the target process and copying  module and 

Initializing  supplemental  data  and  code  with  import  from  kernel32.dll  library,  and 

1. 
supplemental code into the newly allocated buffer; 
2. 
overwriting the first bytes of the entry point of the process image; 
3. 
Mapping the module to inject into the address space of the process, initializing import 
address  table,  fixing  relocations,  calling  its  entry  point  and  restoring  the  original  bytes  of  the 
image entry point. 

 

Figure 4.13 – Injecting a Module into Process Address Space  

 

Stage 1 

When  the  process  image  is  loaded  into  the  address  space  of  the  process,  the  notification  routine  is 
called and the driver determines whether the process is debugged. If it isn’t, it looks in its configuration 
data to get the name of the module to inject. Once it obtains the name of the module it allocates two 
buffers  in  the  process,  one  for  the  module  and  another  for  supplemental  code.  Then  it  sets  memory 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

protection of the entry point region to PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY, a value which makes it writable. In 
the following figure we can see a layout of the modules in the user-mode address space of the process: 

 

Figure 4.14 – Layout of Modules and Buffers in User-Mode Address Space of a Process Prior to Loading kernel32.dll Library 

 

 

Stage 2 

At the second stage, when the driver receives notification that kernel32.dll has been mapped into the 
address space of the process, it initializes import of the supplemental code from the loaded library and 
overwrites the first seven bytes of the entry point of the process image with the following commands: 

 

Figure 4.15 – Patched entry point 

 

APIs  exported  by  kernel32.dll  and  used  by  supplemental  code  are:  VirtualAlloc,  VirtualFree, 
GetProcAddress,  GetModuleHandle,  LoadLibraryA,  LoadLibraryW, 
lstrcmpi,  GetVersionEx, 
DeviceIoControl. The layout of the modules at this stage is presented on the following figure:

Stage 3 

63 

At this stage, when the entry point of the application receives control it transfers to the entry point of 
the supplemental code, the purpose of which is to map the module and call its entry point. When the 
work is finished it restores the original entry point and sets the memory protection value of the entry 
point region to its initial value. Then it transfers control to the original entry point.

DeviceIoControl 

The driver creates a device object with the name specified in Table 4.2.1 and registers handlers for the 
following requests: 

 

 

 

IRP_MJ_CREATE; 
IRP_MJ_CLOSE; 
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL. 

The first two handlers do nothing but successfully complete IRP packet, while the third handler is used 
to  dispatch  control  requests  from  an  application.  When  the  created  device  object  receives  an 
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request with IOCTL equal to 0x223800 it changes memory protection of the 
region specified in the request parameters: 

 

 

 

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

When supplemental code changes memory protection of the entry point it initializes this structure and 
passes it as a parameter to DeviceIoControl API.  

4.2.2  MRXNET.sys  

The purpose of this driver is to hide files that are used to propagate the malware through USB drives. It 
acts  as  a  file  system  driver  filter.  In  the  very  beginning  of  its  initialization  it  registers  the 
FileSystemRegistrationChange routine enables it to attach to file systems available in the system, but it 
is  interested  only  in  ntfs,  fat  and  cdfs  file  systems.  When  a  new  file  system  is  mounted  the  driver 
receives a notification, creates a device object and attaches it to the top of the device stack. From then 
on  the  driver  is  able  to monitor  all  the  requests  that  are addressed to  the  file  system.  It waits  for  an 
IRP_MJ_MOUNT_VOLUME  request  to  arrive  and  attaches  itself  to  the  mounted  volume  to  intercept 
requests  related  to  operations  with  files  and  directories.  It  creates  DeviceObjects  and  attaches  it  to 
those device objects created by and corresponding to the specified file system drivers. The driver hooks 
IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL  requests  addressed  to  the  file  systems  it  is  attached  to,  enabling  it  to 
filter  results  from  querying  information  about  files  and  subdirectories.  This  request  is  used  to  get 
information related to the directory, and in particular what files are located in the directory. 

It hides the same files as ~WTR4141.tmp does: 

 

files with ".LNK" extension with a file length of 1471 (0x104b) bytes; 
files  with  ".TMP"  extension  where  the  name  consists  of  12  characters  (including  extension)  in 
 
the following format: "~WTRabcd.TMP", where a,b,c,d are digits from 0 to 9 which sum modulo 10 
equals 0 ("~WTR4411.TMP" for example). 

On  receiving  an  IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL  request  it  sets  an  IO  completion  routine  that  filters 
results  of the request. Depending on the control operation that is requested, the driver goes through 
the corresponding structure and deletes all entries matching the search criteria. 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

4.4  Remote Communication Protocol 

66 

The  malware  communicates  to  the  C&C  server  through  http.  A  list  of  URLs  is  included  in  the  Stuxnet 
configuration data of Stuxnet: 

 

 

 

 

www.windowsupdate.com; 
www.msn.com; 
www.mypremierfutbol.com; 
www.todaysfutbol.com 

The first two URLs are used to check that the system has connection to the Internet, while the third and 
the fourth are URLs of C&C servers.  If it fails to successfully establish connection with the remote host 
(www.windowsupdate.com) it stops sending data to the C&C server.  

When the malware  confirms  that the infected computer is connected to the Internet it sends  an  http 
request to the remote server. Here is an example of the URL with data: 

http:// www.mypremierfutbol.com/index.php?data=data_to_send, 

where data_to_send is encrypted and encoded message. 

It uses a custom encryption algorithm with a key length equal 31 bytes: 

// Encryption 

char Key[31] = { 

0x67, 0xA9, 0x6E, 0x28, 0x90, 0x0D, 0x58, 0xD6,

0xBD, 0x7C, 0x71, 0x5E, 0x42, 0xE4, 0xC1  

}; 

// Encryption procedure 

void EncryptData(char *Buffer, int BufferSize, char *Key) 

{ 

 

 

 

} 

for (int i = 0 ; i < BufferSize ; i ++) 

 

Buffer[i] ^= Key[i % 31]; 

return; 

The encrypted data are represented as a string of Unicode characters: each byte of the binary data is 
presented as 2 characters. For instance, 0x7A96E2890 will be written as "7A96E2890" Unicode string. 

The data to be sent have the following structure: 
 

 

     

                                                                                                                                       www.eset.com

The  first  byte  of  the  data  is  a  hexadecimal  constant  0x01,  followed  by  16  bytes  of  the  malware 
configuration data. The IP address of the host is the first non-loopback entry in the list of IPv4 addresses 
of the host sorted in the ascending order. 

While preparing the  data  to be  sent  the  malware  gathers information about  all the network adapters 
installed on the system by calling the GetAdaptersInfo API. This includes: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The adapter name; 
The adapter description; 
The hardware address of the adapter; 
The list of IPv4 addresses associated with the adapter; 
The IPv4 address of the gateway for the adapter;

}; 

 

 

We can see that flags corresponding to the first and the last bits in the byte are unused. Flags 1,4,5,6 are 
related to the configuration data of the malware. Flag 2 signifies whether Stuxnet is active. Flag 3 is set 
in case Stuxnet detects Siemens software installed on the infected machine, which it does by searching 
in the registry the following keys and values: 

 

 

Key – HKLM\SOFTWARE\SIEMENS\STEP7, value – STEP7_Version; 
Key – HKLM\SOFTWARE\SIEMENS\WinCC\Setup, value – Version. 

 

When the message is constructed, the malware encrypts it by XORing each byte with the hexadecimal 
constant 0xFF.  The malware receives a response from the C&C server which is structured as follows: 

Figure 4.21 – The Structure of the Response from the C&C Server 

 

 

The first four bytes of the response store the size of the image in the received data: if image size plus 5 
bytes isn't equal to the size of the received data, then Stuxnet stops parsing the response. On receiving 
the response the malware loads the image and call its export with ordinal number 1. The fifth byte of 
the response specifies exactly how it should be executed. If this byte is set to 0x01, then an RPC function 
will be called and as a result the received image will be executed at the address of the process hosting 
Stuxnet's RPC server. If the fifth byte is zero, then the image will be loaded into the address space of this 
process  and  an  export  function  numbered  as  1  will  be  executed.  The  following  figure  clarifies  this 
mechanism:

Conclusion 

70 

We conducted a detailed technical analysis of the worm Win32/Stuxnet, which currently is perhaps the 
most technologically sophisticated malicious program developed for a targeted attack to date. We have 
not released extensive information here about injecting code into the SCADA system, as it deserves an 
independent  discussion  (and  indeed,  has  been  discussed  at  length  by  Langner).  This  research  was 
intended  primarily  as  material  for  specialists  in  information  security,  showing  how  technology  can  be 
made use of in targeted attacks. 

Thanks to everyone who finished reading our report until the end!
