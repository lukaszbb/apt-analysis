Palebot trojan harvests Palestinian online credentials
December 8, 2011 by Snorre Fagerland -

I sometimes sample the stream of files that come from VirusTotal, so as not to lose touch with what
malware is actually floating around. Of special interest are the files where few or only we have detection,
because there is a higher probability that such files are false positives that need to be removed. However,
yesterday I found an interesting file.

Firts of all, it was relatively clear that it was no false positive, since sandbox and live systems confirmed
that it installed using the file name svcshost.exe. It was obviously mimicking the legitimate program
svchost.exe, which is a pretty telling hint.

Looking at the file revealed out-of-the ordinary traits. It was over 750k in size, and this is somewhat
unusual for trojans. It was not packed or obfuscated, so by just looking at the file image some strings
jumped out:

The lowermost of these URL’s appears to be a webmail front for the Palestinian National Authority.  The
list shown is used as input to a function that has as purpose to grab user credentials from IntelliForms.
IntelliForms is the name for the autocomplete function that exists in Internet Explorer. The full list of
targeted sites is:

“https://login.live.com/”
“http://facebook.com/”
“http://www.facebook.com/”
“http://hotmail.com/”
“http://gmail.com/”
“http://mail.google.com/”
“https://portal.iugaza.edu.ps/”

“https://www.google.com/”

“http://www.myspace.com”
“http://paypal.com”

Digging further into the origin of this file, I find that it is dropped by a WinRAR SFX installer which also
extracts and shows the document below (excerpt):

The full text seems to be taken from an article in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Sabah (Google translated): 
www.alsbah.net.

The document, aylol.doc, contains very little metadata, so we are not talking about complete newbies in

the targeted attack business.

There are apparently at least two versions of this trojan around. Norman Sandbox technology detected
these proactively as W32/Malware, but they will be renamed to Palebot.A!apt and B!apt.

The trojan is still in analysis, and further details may be published later.
