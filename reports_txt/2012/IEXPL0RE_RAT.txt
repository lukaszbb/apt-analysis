IEXPL0RE RAT 

BY SETH HARDY  |  AUGUST 2012

INTRODUCTION
This report describes a remote access trojan (RAT) that three human rights-related organiza-
tions taking part in a Citizen Lab study on targeted cyber threats against human rights groups 
received via email in 2011 and at the end of 2010. Here we refer to it as the IEXPL0RE RAT, 
after the name of the launcher program. It was first called “Sharky RAT” in Seth Hardy’s talk at 
SecTor 2011. Since then it has also been referred to as c0d0so0 and possibly Backdoor.Briba.

A RAT is a program that allows a remote user full access to a computer. This type of program 
can be used for legitimate reasons. In these cases, RAT can also stand for remote administration 
tool. In the case of the IEXPL0RE RAT, the remote user has the ability to record user keystrokes 
(including passwords), copy and delete files, download and run new programs, and even use the 
computer’s microphone and camera to listen to and watch the user in real-time.

RATs are common in targeted malware attacks against human rights organizations and other 
NGOs. Targeted attacks with this sort of payload are often referred to as advanced persistent 
threats (APTs). APTs differ from other traditional computer attacks in that they are designed to 
be quiet and collect data over time, and act as a starting point for future tracking and compro-
mise of targets. It is not uncommon for an APT infection to persist for months or even years after 
the malicious program is first run.

2

ATTACK VECTOR
Attempted delivery of the malware was via email attachment, employing social engineering tech-
niques. The emails that contained the attached IEXPL0RE RAT were different every time, with 
a unique email and delivery method used for each attempt, including multiple versions targeted 
at the same organization. Each email was tailored specifically for the target, both in terms of 
subject, content, and the way the RAT was attached and hidden.

Organization 1: a human rights NGO received multiple emails with interesting keywords from 
senders claiming to be from personal friends. These emails included an executable attachment 
in a password-protected archive, which helps prevent detection by antivirus software. The pass-
word was included in the email address.

Organization 2: a news organization operating a website that reports on developments in China, 
received an email containing a story about a high-rise apartment building fire. Attached to the 
email were four images and two executable files (.scr extensions) designed to look like images 
using the Unicode right-to-left override character. When each executable file is run, it will install 
and launch the malware, drop an image, open the image, and delete itself. The end result is that 
only an image is left, making the email look more legitimate if the malware is run (figure 1).

Organization 3: a Tibet-related organization received two emails with different versions of the 
malware attached. The first file was an executable file designed to appear as a video of a speech 
by the Dalai Lama, attached to an email about a year review of Tibetan human rights issues 
(figure 2). The second file was embedded in an Excel spreadsheet attached to an email pretend-
ing to be from a conference on climate change.

Emails that contain malicious attachments use a variety of social engineering techniques to 
appear more legitimate. Methods include using names of real people and organizations, choosing 
material that is directly related to the target’s interests, and including chains of fake forwards to 
make it appear as if the email has been circulated.

Including the attachments in a RAR file makes them less likely to be discovered by an antivirus 
(AV) scanner. Putting a password on the archive and including it in the email reduces the chanc-
es of AV discovery even further.

A newer version of the RAT payload was later distributed via email in multiple RTF documents 
to organization 3. The RTF dropped a DLL alongside a legitimate program vulnerable to DLL in-
jection, allowing the program to run without a warning that the program is not digitally signed. 
StrokeIt, a program for using mouse gestures, uses a file named config.dll without verifying the 
authenticity of the file. By replacing config.dll with the RAT downloader, the malicious code is 
run while appearing more legitimate to the operating system (figure 3).

MALWARE
The IEXPL0RE RAT is delivered inside an executable program or document, which is custom-
generated for each email. When a user opens the document or runs the program, it installs a 
launcher program on the computer. Antivirus programs frequently fail to detect the launcher 
program as malicious, as it is custom built for each specific target: the file contains a configura-
tion file unique to the target, which is different each time it is sent out. This method is used to 
defeat signature-based antivirus programs, which only scan for files that are known to be mali-
cious. As the launcher program is newly generated every time, it will never end up on a signa-
ture list until after it is already been used.

Once installed on a system, the launcher program goes through multiple programs to unpack a 
contained file (the actual RAT) before it can run. The IEXPL0RE.EXE (or other launcher) pro-
gram contains multiple programs, layered like an onion, which eventually unpack a DLL (dy-
namic link library, another form of executable file). The file name varies, but starts with “perf” 
and has an extension of .dat, and is saved to the %temp% folder (often C:\Documents and Set-
tings\user\Local Settings\Temp).

Once the perf*.dat file is saved to disk, it runs (via injection into svchost.exe, a Windows program) and 
extracts another DLL into memory. This program is called “ContainerV2,” as it is referenced from within 
the program, although it is never written to the disk. ContainerV2 connects to the Internet and down-
loads another DLL called “client”. The client is also kept in memory and never written to the disk. Once 
downloaded, ContainerV2 will run the client, which does all of the IEXPL0RE RAT work (figure 4).

FIGURE 4: STRUCTURE OF THE RAT LAUNCHER PROGRAM.

6

For Organization 1, the executable launch process looks like this:

••

.exe(attached file, launcher): appears as a text document; when run, displays a fake error 

message saying the file can’t be found (figure 5)

 • csv.exe (runs and exits quickly)
 • 360tray.exe (runs and exits quickly)
 • svchost.exe (with injected perf*.dat code)
 • ContainerV2 (injected into svchost.exe)
 • client (downloaded and run in memory)

FIGURE 5:  
SOCIAL ENGINEERING TECHNIQUE: A FAKE ERROR MESSAGE HIDING THE FACT THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM.

One advantage of downloading the final stage is that if the attacker wanted to update the RAT 
software (to add new functionality for example), it can be done very easily. Because code is down-
loaded every time the malware starts, if the code is changed on the server side, existing compro-
mised machines will automatically update themselves the next time they are restarted. Over the 
time spent analyzing this malware, the client program did have minor changes, possibly bug fixes.

MD5 hashes, also called message digests, are often used to identify a file based on its content. 
A hash is a string of hexadecimal characters that identifies a file. Should the file change in any 
way, the hash will as well. Hashes are designed to be easy to compute from a full file, but it is 
very difficult to find two files with the same hash. 

Use of hashes in the context of the IEXPL0RE RAT is difficult, as the downloaded client may 
change, and the ContainerV2 program is different for every target. One of the main differences 
that guarantees that the hash will always be unique is that the configuration file for the RAT 
(including which command and control servers to connect to) is included in the program.

INFECTION
Once the launcher program is run, it will install the IEXPL0RE binary and a startup link in the 
Start Menu:

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\IEXPL0RE.LNK
C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IEXPL0RE.EXE

It also leaves traces of the extracted binary and the link file (the .tmp file below) in %temp%:

C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Temp\31A.tmp
C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Temp\perf6cd2e5e9.dat

The RAT also uses a few files for configuration and recording keystrokes:

C:\WINDOWS\system\lock.dat
C:\WINDOWS\system\MSMAPI32.SRG
C:\WINDOWS\system32\STREAM.SYS

When run, IEXPL0RE will connect to a command and control (C2) server for updates, sending key-
logger data, and asking for RAT commands. The C2 server is specified in a configuration file built 
into the RAT program. Each RAT instance is likely built using a packaging program. The configu-
ration file allows for a primary server and an alternate, and may use either a domain or IP.

8

Each of the IEXPL0RE samples analyzed uses a different set of C2 servers. One sample uses two 
domains that point to the same IP. The IP changes every few days to few weeks, but remains 
in one network block located in China. Other samples use either a single domain name and no 
backup, or a fixed IP with a localhost address as backup. The localhost address is a way to find 
and use a proxy, for example, if a computer is using a circumvention system such as Tor. Of the 
two samples using fixed IPs, both were sent to the same organization, and one appears to be a 
replacement for the other. Both C2 servers are currently down.

C2 COMMUNICATION
IEXPL0RE has two different methods of communication: HTTP POST and GET. It also has the 
ability to use a HTTP CONNECT proxy. POST is the preferred method of communication; if it 
does not work, it will also attempt a GET connection.

All communication from the client to the server is encrypted with a one-byte XOR key 0xCD. 
(Information in this report shows the data after decryption.) POST commands put the data in 
the request body, while GET commands put the data in URL parameters. Server responses are 
all 200 OK messages with data in the body.

The system keeps track of the communication using a sequence number, which is part of the 
requested URL. The sequence number is nine digits long, starts at 000000001, and generally 
increments by one for each packet sent. When authenticated, the sequence number jumps to 
000001000; if disconnected, the sequence number returns to the next sub-1000 number expected.

THE HEADERS OF THE REQUEST LOOK LIKE THIS:

POST /index000000001.asp HTTP/1.1
Accept-Language: en-us
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1;)
Host: update.microsoft.com
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 000041

The Accept-Language, User-Agent, Connection, and Content-Type headers are always fixed. The 
Host header is also always fixed as update.microsoft.com; any requests to the C2 server made 
without this header in place will be rejected, often with a redirect to Microsoft’s website.

When run, ContainerV2 communicates with the C2 server, first establishing a socket by a three-way 
handshake. Below, the text at the start of the arrow indicates the packet type, sequence number, and 
connection socket. For example, “POST 2 (1)” means that it is using an HTTP POST request, sequence 
number 2, on the first established connection (figure. 6). The text on the line is the data in the packet 
after decryption.

FIGURE 6: FIRST C2 CONNECTION 

9

Once the first connection has been established, a second connection is made using a similar 
handshake (figure 7).

FIGURE 7: SECOND C2 CONNECTION 

When the second connection has been established, the ContainerV2 program uses it to download 
the client and run it (figure 8).

FIGURE 8: BINARY DOWNLOAD 

10

Once control has been handed off to the client, one connection is used for sending keylogger data from 
the client to the server, and the other connection is used to request RAT commands from the server.

With the protocol reversed (see Appendix B for a full listing of commands), it was straightfor-
ward to write a program that communicates with the C2 server, downloads the client, and sends 
back commands as desired. The program maintains the two sockets, sending heartbeat/command 
request packets at a specified interval, while sending back empty keylogger packets to trick the 
server into thinking the system is idle (figure 9).

CAPABILITIES
The IEXPL0RE RAT contains over 40 commands that an attacker can use to manipulate the 
file system and registry, download and run additional programs, and find and exfiltrate data. 
An infected computer defaults to recording keystrokes and sending this data back to the server 
at regular intervals. The additional commands are there for interactive control of the system in 
real-time by an attacker.

This program is likely used in multiple phases. After infection, the keylogger records data in-
cluding email addresses and passwords. Once an account’s credentials have been captured, the 
attacker can log in and set up a forwarding address or download all of the data stored online. 
Once a compromised machine has been determined useful by looking at the keylogger data, an 
attacker can use the RAT functionality to download files and install more specific malware - for 
example, a Skype plugin that records calls.

While post-infection behaviour from an attacker against a real target has not been observed in 
this investigation, this is a standard method in targeted attacks.

One particular area of interest with this RAT is that it contains a specific functionality for pl-
ugins relating to video and audio capture. Each time the malware connects to the command and 
control server, it sends a list of all video capture devices present on the computer. This behav-
iour may indicate that the attacker is specifically interested in seeing who is on the other end of 
the computer, and is actively collecting data on what the targets look like.

For a full list of the commands supported by IEXPL0RE and a description of what they do, see 
Appendix B: Command Enumeration.

DETECTION AND MITIGATION
A system infected with the IEXPL0RE RAT can be found by looking for presence of the IEX-
PL0RE files, or by watching network traffic.

In addition to the IEXPL0RE.EXE file itself, presence of the perf*.dat files and link files in 
%temp% are an indicator that the system is infected. The timestamps on the files are an indica-
tion of how long the system has been infected.

A network intrusion detection system (IDS) can identify infected machines by looking for well-
known traffic patterns. The simplest of these is checking for HTTP traffic to /index[0-9]{9}.asp. 
Blocking this traffic will prevent the infected machine from communicating with the C2 server, 
receiving new commands, and sending back keylogger data. 

The C2 IP or hostname can also be blocked directly once it’s found, at the network level or (as a 
temporary measure) in the infected computer’s hosts file.

13

REMOVAL
A running copy of IEXPL0RE can be stopped by killing the appropriate svchost process. This 
process is identifiable as it is not in the correct place in the process tree. In figure 10, this is the 
last process in the list, PID 1256:

FIGURE 10: PROCESS EXPLORER SHOWING THE INFECTED SVCHOST.EXE PROCESS (1256).

The process can be killed with the Process Explorer tool, part of the Sysinternals package  
(figure 10).

Once the process has been terminated, removal is as simple as deleting the installed files (see 
the section on Infection above for a list).

CONCLUSIONS
The IEXPL0RE RAT is a good example of the current state of APT attacks, especially those tar-
geting human rights organizations and NGOs. While they are not particularly advanced from a 
technical standpoint, they are custom designed to appeal to and pique the interest of the recipient. 

The attacker uses social engineering to get a foot in the door of an organization. All it takes is 
for one user to run a malicious program that looks like a legitimate video, spreadsheet, or other 
document. Once running on a user’s machine, the program will silently record passwords and 
provide the attacker a way of accessing sensitive data.

This report describes what is “normal” in this area, by detailing what a common attack looks like 
at each step of the way, from when an email is first received to when data leaves the network. 
Many APT campaigns like the one presented in this report exist and continue to steal data every 
day, but are both avoidable and correctable. 

The IEXPL0RE RAT is under active development, as both the client and server components are 
continuously changing. The server in particular has exhibited different behavior over time, mostly 
related to blocking unauthorized access from the outside world. For example, the redirect to Micro-
soft’s website when referencing an invalid URL was not present when this investigation began. The 
presence of development work or upgrades implies that this system is actively used and monitored.
