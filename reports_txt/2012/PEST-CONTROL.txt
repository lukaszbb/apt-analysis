Remote Administration Tools (RATs) allow a 
remote attacker to control and access the 
system. In this paper, we present our analysis of 
their protocols, explain how to decrypt their 
traffic, as well as present vulnerabilities we have 
found.

Introduction
As 2012 Matasano summer interns, we were tasked with running a research 
project with a couple criteria:
• It should be something we are both interested in.
• We should be able to present our research for the company at the end of 

our internship. However, on completion, we decided that it would be best if 
we made our findings public.

With John Villamil, our advisor, we decided that given our interest in low-level 
analysis, we should analyze Remote Administration Tools (RATs). RATs have  
recent seen media attention RATs due to their use by oppressive governments 
in spying on activists and other “dissidents”. We felt this to be a perfect 
project.
Remote Administration Tools are pieces of software which, once installed on a 
victim’s computer allow a remote user to control and access the system. RATs 
can be used legitimately by system administrators, or they can be used 
maliciously. 
There are a variety of methods by which they are installed on a computer: 
Various social engineering tactics can be employed to get a user to open the 
executable, they can be bundled with other pieces of software, they can be 
installed as the payload of a virus or worm, or they can be installed after an 
attacker gains access to a system through an exploit. Most of the commonly 
available RATs are at least able to perform keylogging, screen and camera 
capture, file management, code and script execution, power control, registry 
management, and password sniffing. Wikipedia has a more complete list of 
common RAT functionality [1]. 
Our research focused on analyzing several publicly available RATs: DarkComet, 
Bandook, CyberGate and Xtreme RAT. Interestingly, all of the RATs we 
analyzed were coded either in part or entirely in Delphi. They all featured a 
reverse connecting architecture, as well as some form of cryptography or 
obfuscation of their communications. In this paper, we present our analysis of 
their protocols, explain how to decrypt their traffic, as well as present 
vulnerabilities we have found. The appendices to this paper contain MITM 
tools for decrypting traffic, as well as proof of concept exploits for the 
vulnerabilities we’ve found.

Basic RAT Architecture
Most RATs employ a “reverse-connecting” architecture. 
The “client” program, resides on the attacker’s machine and is used to control 
a compromised system. If often features a full UI designed for ease of use. 
In contrast, the “server” program is a much smaller stub which is installed on 
the compromised computer. These servers feature no UI, and take measures 
to disguise their presence. 
On execution, the sever initiates a connection back to the client computer, 
and remote control is then possible. The client program typically has the 
ability to generate server stubs, which have the IP address of the client (the 
command and control center) hard coded into them. 
Some free versions of the RATs we investigated were feature limited to 
producing server stubs that were not stealthy or could only connect to 
localhost, with the ability to generate “full” stubs only available on purchasing 
the paid version. Some servers had measures to defeat or disable antivirus 
and firewall software on the compromised machine. 

The DarkComet RAT
DarkComet is one of the most popular RATs in use today, gaining recent 
notoriety after its use by the Syrian government [13]. The encryption method 
used in DarkComet has already been extensively analyzed by various 
researchers [2] [3], so we will not reiterate here. 
We reverse engineered the DarkComet protocol and analyzed it for 
vulnerabilities.
After a quick look at its protocol, it is easy to see that it uses a “|” as it’s 
delimiter between string parameters. Although, there is no delimiter between 
the command and the first parameter.
The DarkComet client stores information about servers in a SQLite database, 
which is kept in the directory from which the client runs. This database also 
holds usernames and passwords for FTP servers to which the client has been 
configured to connect. When a new connection is established, a handshake 
occurs which looks like this:

For testing purposes, we wrote our own “server” which replied with the 
following shorter SIN (Server Info) string:
	infoesX|1|S|5|0s|W |x||US|I]|{7}|80%|E|6|5

SQL Injection in DarkComet
By attaching a debugger to the client, we were able to view the SQL strings it 
generated by the client to query its database. Upon connection with the 
above SIN string, the following SQL statement is executed:
	"SELECT * FROM dc_users WHERE UUID="{7}"
If that UUID is not in the database, the following statement is executed:
	"INSERT INTO dc_users VALUES( "{7}", "1", "S", "W", "0")"
If that UUID already exists, then the following statement is executed:
	"UPDATE dc_users SET userIP="1" WHERE UUID="{7}""
There is no input validation or sanitization, so all of these SQL statements are 
injectable with the following caveats:
• Executing multiple commands in one statement with “;”s is disabled, 

anything after a “;” will not be executed

• load_extension() is disabled
These can be used to modify data in the database. We did not further 
develop these vulnerabilities to get information out of the database, as our 
next exploit made doing so unnecessary.

Arbitrary File Read from the Client’s File System in DarkComet
DarkComet uses a protocol that we have termed “QuickUp” in order to do 
ad-hoc uploading of files. For instance, the client has a feature which allows 
you to edit the compromised computers “hosts” file. This is done by 
downloading the hosts file to the client computer, editing it, and then 
uploading it back to the server. The last part of that exchange uses the 
QuickUp protocol, and looks like this:

DarkComet QuickUpload

C->S: 
QUICKUPC:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\SynHosts.txt|752|HOSTS
A new connection between the client and server is now established to 
handle the file transfer. The old connection is not closed first, the existing 
socket just has connect() called on it again

Note that the protocol consists of two stages, the QUICKUP command issued 
from the client, which establishes a “new” connection, and the QUICKUP 
command issued from the server, which begins the file transfer. Most 
importantly, after the new connection has been opened, the server requests 
the file to be uploaded. Three major weaknesses are present in this 
implementation:
• There is no check that the file in the client QUICKUP is the same as the file 

in the server QUICKUP

• The client responds to a QUICKUP commands, even if there was no 

corresponding QUICKUP from the client

• The client allows the server to specify the absolute path
This flaw allows the retrieval of any file on the filesystem that it has 
permissions to read. So for instance, to get a dump of the SQLite database, 
we can do the following:
(1) Connect to the server and successfully complete the handshake
(2) Open a new connection over our old one, the client will now reply:

DarkComet SQLite DB Dump

C->S:

We now send a QUICKUP command unprompted

S->C (U):
A
C->S (U):
LENGTH_OF_FILE
S->C (U):
A
C->S (U):
RAW_DATA_OF_COMET.DB

Any file in the DarkComet directory can be read this way. Alternatively, 
absolute paths can be specified, allowing read access to any file on the client’s 
filesystem (that DarkComet has permissions to access). 

Reading “C:\secret.txt” from Client’s File System

Reading “C:\secret.txt” from Client’s File SystemOverall, this presents an issue 
for anyone using DarkComet. If a server sample is discovered, it is trivial to 
retrieve the key from the binary that is used in the network communication. 
The key retrieval process can even be automated [4]. Recently, the developer 
of the RAT has quit any further development due to its misuse, therefore 
leaving this issue unpatched [12].
For a stub server (written in python) that can exploit both of these 
vulnerabilities, see Appendix A.

The Bandook RAT
Bandook is written in a mix of C++ and Delphi [5] [6]. The server is able to use 
process injection, API unhooking, and kernel patching to bypass (some 
versions) of the Windows firewall. The server itself is fairly limited in 
functionality, but has the ability to be extended through a plugin architecture: 
the client can upload plugin code to the server. The client comes with several 
plugins which need to be installed on the server to enable full functionality. By 
default, the server attempts to hide itself by creating a process based on the 
default browser settings.
It lacks any real cryptography to protect its traffic. Instead, it obfuscates its 
traffic by XORing against the constant 0xE9:

XOR Loop with Constant 

Almost all messages are suffixed with “&&&” in cleartext:

Server Keepalive with “&&&” 

The client comes bundled with TightVNC 1.2.9.0, which has a publicly 
known security vulnerability. More information regarding the vulnerability 
and proof of concept code is available online [7].
The latest public release of Bandook is v1.35, while the private version is 
at 1.4. The public version was released April 2007, which makes it quite 
old and outdated. It only supports up to Windows Vista, while the private 
version supports up to Win7.

Reverse Engineering The Bandook Protocol
We will leave out the “&&&” cleartext suffix from our analysis. 
Establishing a connection with the client is simple. The server will start by 
sending one command:

Bandook Connection Initialization

S -> C: 
&first& # 0d 1h 15m # Admin #  # 172.16.250.128  / WhiteHouse 
#yes#yes#no#no#bndk13me#USA#no#yes#yes#

So a “first” command is used to establish a connection. The fields separated 
by “#” correspond to info displayed in the client, such as IP, username, 
uptime, and location. The fields marked yes/no correspond to whether the 
server has a given plugin or not. 
The keepalive is as follows:

Bandook Keepalive

C -> S: 
&BANG&
S-> C: 
&BAMG&

To see the protocol for additional functionality, we recommend using the 
MITM decoder in Appendix B. To any researchers who are interested in 
further work on Bandook, we have a fairly detailed set of notes on the 
additional functionality protocols, which is available upon request. 

The CyberGate RAT
CyberGate is another RAT written in Delphi. It’s also the only RAT we saw that 
featured protection against reverse engineering. Using LordPE to obtain a 
dump, you can see the following strings: 

CyberGate Anti-Analysis

Both PEiD and Detect It Easy could not identify what packer had been used. 
We worked on unpacking it, until we finally discovered a tool called 
ProtectionID. This was able to identify the packer as Safengine Licensor. From 
some basic research, we discovered that unpacking the Safengine Licensor is a 
project in itself. Due to our time constraint, we found it would be best to 
continue our efforts analyzing another RAT. 
Before moving on though, we were able to uncover enough information about 
its protocol from the server stubs we created (which aren’t packed). 
Interestingly, CyberGate uses two different schemes for communication.
Communication from the client to the server is done using a variant of 
base64. The messages are base64 encoded, except instead of the 
canonical base64 string: 
“ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567
89+/” 
the string used is 
"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx
yz+/"
This is an obfuscation technique that is also common in enterprise 
software; because the base64 dictionary has been scrambled, a standard 
base64 decoder produces gibberish when fed the data. 
The base64 encoded messages end with the string “###@@@”, which when 
replaced with “==” and then fed into a base64 decoder (working against the 
custom string), produce cleartext. 
In the other direction, messages going from the server to the client are first 
compressed using zlib (at a compression level of 1), and then encrypted with 
RC4 against the following key:

	

njgnjvejvorenwtrnionrionvironvrnvcg210public

They are then prefixed with the string “@@XXXXXXXXXX@@”
Based off of this information, we think it’s safe to assume the private version 
will have some subtle differences in its communication. Most likely the key is 
different, but the overall communication architecture is the same.

Xtreme RAT

Xtreme RAT was another one of the RATs used by the Syrian government. We 
haven’t seen much public analysis of Xtreme RAT. The guys over at malware.lu 
published a simple article covering a sample they received in an email. Their

analysis covered identifying and decrypting config information from the stub 
[10]. Our analysis will look into the communication protocol of the RAT.
Before looking at any internals, we opted to get a feel for the UI. On the first 
run, users are prompted to enter a password. Once entered, the program asks 
users to retype the password to confirm it. After doing so, a file named 
“user.info” is created in the same directory. This file is simply a unicode string 
of the MD5 hash of your password. 

Unicode MD5 Hash of Password in 

So if your password is “123”, your user.info will contain the hash 
‘a933d13f81649bebe035dc21f4002ff1’. However, when we tried hashing 
“123” we found a different result (the correct hash is 
‘202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70’.) It turns out this is an issue that was 
introduced in Delphi 2009, when the default string type switched from ANSI 
strings to unicode strings. The MD5 implementation is not unicode aware [11], 
leading to incorrect hashes. 
When creating a server, we tried to change the password from its default 
‘0123456789’. It turns out Xtreme RAT limits your password to being only 
digits. It also rejects any password that cannot fit in a 32-bit signed integer. 
Well, that’s not making us feel very secure.
The public version also limits the user to creating a stub which can only 
connect to localhost on port 81. It also includes an annoying nag screen 
notifying the user that it is the public version. However, all the functionality of 
the private version is present. In order to begin analyzing its communication, 
we had to change the communication IP. First, a quick analysis of the server 
stub.

The Xtreme RAT Server
The stub sets itself up using a classic technique found in basic malware. It first 
uses CreateProcess() to create a new process (named based on the default 
browser.) 

CreateProcess() Based on Default 

Next, it uses WriteProcessMemory() to copy code to the newly created process 
(PE header starts at 0x1610000).

It finishes the setup by simply resuming the thread using ResumeThread(). 
After patching the process to have an opcode of 0xEBFE, which is an infinite 
loop, at the point where the thread resumes, we attached a debugger and 
noticed that the process begins packed with UPX.

Unpacking is trivial from this point. Locate the JMP following the POPAD

nag screen, we were able to start our analysis of the communication.

54015d0b4a08f2d0

The communication of Xtreme RAT begins with the server making a 
connection to the client. We then have the following:

Xtreme RAT Identify Message

S ->C (U): 
myversion|3.6 Public\r\n

The client acknowledges by sending:

Xtreme RAT ACK

C ->S (U):
\x58\x0d\x0a

Communication continues with the client asking for info about the server. 
Notice that before any message sent, the stub or client will first send the 
password and length of the message to come, in little endian format. 
Annoyingly, sometimes it sends this header as its own packet, sometimes it 
comes prefixed to the actual content. And sometimes it prefixes the header 
with an ACK of “\x58\x0d\x0a”. In this example, the password is 1234 and the 
length of the message to follow is 166 bytes.

Xtreme RAT Password/Length Message
C -> S: 
\xd2\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xa6\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00
|-> Password = 0x4d2 = 1234
         |->Four bytes padding
                         |-> Length = 0xa6 = 166                                                                      
                                               |->Four bytes padding

 

 
Now what follows is some zlib compressed data with size 166 bytes. Note that 
sometimes our MITM script fails to decode the zlib compressed data, for 
reasons unknown to us. After decompression we have the following:

Breaking it into its parts we have:

The random string is just that, a random string of length 0x3B or 59. It’s 
generated using the character set: [0-9],[A-Z],[a-z]. The hash is the incorrect 
MD5sum of “XtremeRAT”. This will always remain the same (at least for the 
public version 3.6).
What follows is a response which contains some information about the system. 
It follows the same protocol as before, with the password and length header, 
and the remaining message being compressed with zlib. After this response, 
the stub is now connected to the client, but will continue to send more info, 
such as a screenshot of the desktop and a list of any webcams installed.
At this point, a full connection is established. The client will send a keep alive 
while idle, which looks like the following:

Xtreme RAT Keepalive

C -> S:
ping
S -> C:
pong|937|Current_Window (Server_Name)

Also worth noting, Xtreme has the ability to try to disguise its handshake as 
HTTP. In which case, its opening request will look like (with the default 
password):

Conclusion

RATs represent an under-researched but highly active area of malware “in the 
wild”. With both governments and non-state actors using RATs for 
surveillance, knowledge about them carries increasing significance. A good 
understanding of their protocols is critical to network and system 
administrators deploying tools that can notice the presence of a RAT. 
All of the RATs we analyzed were written in Delphi. This gave the RATs some 
resilience against classical security mistakes (buffer/heap overflows) that are 
much easier to make in a language like C or C++. However, we still found 
serious vulnerabilities in DarkComet, which was the most widely deployed of 
the RATs we studied. Our analysis of the communications should provide a 
solid foundation for other researchers interested in further reverse engineering 
and vulnerability research on RATs. 
Some notable coincidences in behaviors between RATs (use of Delphi, using 
the “|” character as a separator, similar UIs, use of zlib, use of RC4, and other 
protocol similarities) may suggest shared code, although we do not have 
enough evidence to make any definitive statements on that subject. 
Special thanks to John Villamil (@day6reak) for his guidance and 
knowledge on this project, and to the rest of the Matasano Security team!
