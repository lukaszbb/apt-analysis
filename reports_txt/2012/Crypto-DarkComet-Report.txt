Reversing the DarkComet RAT's crypto- 3/13/2012 

Jeff Edwards, Research Analyst, Arbor Networks ASERT 
 
In this article, we will continue our series on reversing DDoS malware crypto systems.  Previous subjects have included 
Armageddon, Khan (now believed to be a very close "cousin" of Dirt Jumper version 5), and PonyDOS.  Today we'll be 
diving deep into the details of DarkComet's crypto.  Over the last several months, we have encountered a large number of 
DarkComet samples, numbering well over a thousand.  DarkComet is primarily a general purpose remote access trojan 
(RAT).  It's capabilities support quite an extensive laundry list of mischief, including but not limited to key logging, web 
cam (and sound card) spying, deleting victim files, scanning ports, hijacking MSN sessions, etc.

Of course the malware includes DDoS capabilities as well - hence our interest in reversing its communications so that we 
can keep tabs on whom the DarkComet botnets are attacking.   In fact, it is believed to have been used as a DDoS weapon 
by supporters of the Syrian regime against opposition forces in the recent Syrian uprisings; TrendMicro has a nice article 
/on this topic. 
 
DarkComet has been studied by a number of researchers. In particular, in November 2011 Laura Aylward of Contextis 
published an excellent analysis [http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/darkcometrat/ ] of Dark Comet in which she 
described the basic cryptographic mechanism used by DarkComet bots to hide their communications; Laura's analysis 
saved us a considerable amount of time.  It was also included in Curt Wilson's recent survey of modern DDoS weapons . 
 
The DarkComet sample upon which we will primarily focus on today is 462,848 bytes in size and has an MD5 hash of 
63f2ed5d2ee50e90cda809f2ac740244.  It happens to be an instance of DarkComet Version 4.2; however, the 
results presented here apply to most other versions of DarkComet as well. 
 
When executed in a sandbox, we observed it connecting to a command & control (C&C) server at newrat2.no-
ip.org on TCP port 1604.  The RAT uses a raw TCP protocol to exchange information with its C&C; on the wire, the 
comms look something like this (modified and re-encrypted to protect some of our sensitive sandbox information):

Figure 2.  Example of DarkComet's encrypted comms 

 

 
These communications are consistent with those reported by Contextis in their DarkComet report.  It certainly looks like an 
initial "phone home" exchange of information, after which the bot and C&C send periodic "Keep Alive" messages to each 
other. Besides being encrypted, this protocol is somewhat unusual in that the C&C sends the first payload; it is much more 
common for the bot to send the first payload. 
 
So in order to develop a tracker that impersonates a DarkComet bot so as to snoop on DDoS attacks, we need to reverse the 
malware's crypto system and write decryption and encryption routines in Python.  Let's start reversing by loading a process 
memory dump of the running bot in IDA Pro.  We'll then start poking around looking for routines that might implement the 
phone home protocol.  Since DarkComet clearly uses raw TCP for communication (as opposed to, say, HTTP), we'll focus 
on finding WinSock2 calls such as socket(), connect(), send(), and recv(). 
 
Well, it turns out that the bot is riddled with vast numbers of WinSock2 calls; not surprising, since DarkComet has a great 
deal of RAT functions that require network communication.  So to narrow down on the actual bot-C&C comms loop, we 

Arbor Networks  |  3 
 

locate the lengthy list of command strings, such as KeylogOn, GetOfflineLogs, WEBCAMLIVE, GetMsnList, 
DDOSHTTPFLOOD, etc.  In particular, we note that all these command strings are referenced from the same function.  
Furthermore, this function is structured as a very long sequence of if-else statements that compare each of these 
command strings against the same buffer.  Even better, there is only a single caller of this function.  Hmmm, that certainly 
sounds like the bot's primary command dispatch routine; we'll call it DispatchCommands_sub_493DAC(). 
 
Checking out the caller function, we see that it operates in a loop.  On each iteration through the loop, it basically performs 
the following actions: 
 
1. Calls recv() to read network traffic into a buffer; 
2. Performs some copies and operations on this buffer to produce an intermediate buffer; 
3. Performs an operation (decryption perhaps?) on the intermediate buffer and a global string to produce a final buffer; 
3. Passes the final buffer to the aforementioned DispatchCommands_sub_493DAC() function; 
 
Yes, this sounds like the main comms loop for which we are looking; we'll name this caller function 
MainCommsLoop_sub_493A30(), and focus our attention on the aforementioned loop: 
 

Arbor Networks  |  4 
 

Arbor Networks  |  5 
 

 

Figure 3.  Function MainCommsLoop_sub_493A30() 

 

It definitely looks like a great candidate for the decryption operation.  It follows the general structure that is quite common 
among bot families that encrypt their comms; namely, a pre-processing operation applied to a buffer, followed by the 
actual decryption step. In particular, one strong clue is that the (assumed) decryption step takes a third argument which, in 
this case, is a reference to a global string - very likely to be the decryption key string! 
 
So first let's see what our (tentatively named) DecryptCommandBuffer_sub_44C628() function looks like.  
DarkComet being a Delphi-based bot, the decryption function is passed the source (encrypted) buffer in EAX, the 
(presumed) crypto key in EDX, and an output string buffer in ECX.  After checking to make sure neither the source nor key 
strings are empty, the function gets down to business.  The first substantive operation is to pass the raw (encrypted) source 
buffer src_buf_var_4 via EAX, along with an output buffer temp_buf_var_420 via EDX, to function 
sub_44C1C0(); the output buffer is then copied back into the original source buffer src_buf_var_4: 
 

Figure 4.  Function DecryptCommandBuffer_sub_44C628() 

 

 

 

 

Arbor Networks  |  6 
 

So sub_44C1C0() seems like it might be doing some pre-processing on the encrypted source buffer; let's see what kind 
of pre-processing it is doing.  Skipping past the obligatory checks for empty source buffers, etc., we arrive at some code 
that loops over the source buffer, referenced by src_buf_var_4; however, it makes only one loop iteration for every 
two bytes in src_buf_var_4.  This is accomplished by extracting the DWORD just in front of the source string and 
shifting it one bit to the right, in order to calculate the number of pairs of source characters: 
 

Figure 5.  Function PreProcess_sub_44C1C0() 

 

 

 

Arbor Networks  |  7 
 

 
This works because in Delphi, the AnsiString class stores its length at an offset of 4 bytes in front of the first actual 
byte of string content: 

Figure 6.  Structure of a Delphi AnsiString 

 

 

For example, in the case of the initial encrypted payload received by the bot from the C&C, 155CAD31A61F , the length 
of the source buffer is 12, so the code will make only 6 iterations through the loop.  On each iteration of the loop, 
DarkComet will process a pair of two source bytes to yield one output byte. 
 
The first operation inside the loop is to test whether or not the value of the first source byte in the pair is greater than 0x39, 
and branch accordingly. After using the one-based index EBX to pull out the first of the two source bytes in the pair, it adds 
0xD0, subtracts 0x0A, and then tests whether the resulting value is greater than or equal to zero.  Since it is operating on 
the 8-bit register AL, the result is that source bytes with values of 0x3A or greater will be processed by one branch, and 
those with values of 0x39 and less will be processed by a second branch: 
 

Arbor Networks  |  8 
 

Figure 7.  Function PreProcess_sub_44C1C0() 

 

 

 

If the first source byte in the pair has value 0x39 or less, the bot will subtract 0x30 from it and save the result to the 
current index within the output buffer: 

Arbor Networks  |  9 
 

 

Figure 8.  Function PreProcess_sub_44C1C0() 

 

 

 

In other words, it will convert the ASCII representations (0x30, 0x31, ..., 0x39) of the digits 0 through 9 into their 
equivalent integer representations (0x00, 0x01, ..., 0x09). 
 
The second branch performs a similar operation: it first tests to make sure that the value of the source byte is not 0x47 or 
greater (in which case it will immediately bail out of the loop and jump to the end of the PreProcess_sub_44C1C0() 
function.)  It will then subtract 0x37 from the source byte and save the result into the current index within the output 
buffer: 

Arbor Networks  |  10 
 

Figure 9.  Function PreProcess_sub_44C1C0() 

 

Arbor Networks  |  11 
 

 

In other words, it will convert the ASCII representations (0x41, 0x42, ..., 0x46) of the upper-case letters A through F 
into their equivalent hexadecimal representations (0x0A, 0x0B, ..., 0x0F). 
 
The two branches (for handling digits and upper-case A through F) will then re-join, and the resulting integer/hexadecimal 
representation of the first source byte will be left-shifted by four (thus multiplying it by 16): 
 

Figure 10.  Function PreProcess_sub_44C1C0() 

 

 

 

At this point, it is pretty clear what is going on.  The PreProcess_sub_44C1C0() function is converting the ASCII 
representation of the source string of bytes into the equivalent hexadecimal representation.  This conjecture is confirmed 
upon inspection of the remaining portion of the loop, which applies the same ASCII-to-hex operation on the second byte of 
each pair of source bytes, and adds the result to the left-shifted output from the first byte of the pair.  So at the end of the 
day, the first line of raw encrypted source payload from the C&C is pre-processed from the 12-character ASCII string 
155CAD31A61F to its equivalent sequence of six hexadecimal bytes 0x15 0x5C 0xAD 0x31 0xA6 0x1F, as follows:

So we will rename this function as Integerize_sub_44C1C0(), and head back to the main 
DecryptCommandBuffer_sub_44C628() function to continue reversing the crypto algorithm.  After the raw source 
buffer has been converted from ASCII form to integer form, the next substantive code block initializes a 256-element 
array stable_var_41C:

Each element in stable_var_41C is a 32-bit DWORD; the elements are initialized to the values 0x00000000 through 
0x000000FF in ascending order:

Figure 13.  Initial state of substitution table stable_var_41C 

 

 
At this point, we can guess that stable_var_41C is going to play the role of a substitution table for decrypting the 
source buffer src_buf_var_4, so let's see how DarkComet builds this table. 
 
After initializing the substitution table to hold all the values between 0x00 and 0xFF in a nice ascending order, it 
proceeds to vigorously scramble up the elements of the table.  It makes 256 iterations through a loop; on each iteration, it 
swaps the positions of two of the elements in the substitution table.  On the kth iteration, one of the swapped elements is 
always the kth element, which is pointed to by register ECX; the other is chosen based on the key string.  The core of the 
loop that scrambles up the substitution table is as follows:

Figure 14.  Function DecryptCommandBuffer_sub_44C628() 

 

th element of stable_var_41C and the value 

th iteration. 

 
The first code block in the above IDA listing chooses which element of stable_var_41C should be swapped with the 
th element.  It uses an accumulator variable, implemented by register EBX and initialized to zero.  On each pass through 
k
the loop, it updates the acccumulator EBX by adding to it the value of the k
of the current key string byte.  One byte of key string is used per iteration, and whenever the key string is "used up", it 
restarts again at the beginning of the key; register EDI holds the length of the key string, so the bot just computes k 
modulo EDI (at instruction 0x0044C767) to choose which byte of the key to use on the k
 
The last code block performs the actual swapping, using swap_temp_var_15 as the temporary variable to do the swap.  
Once 256 such swaps have been performed, the loop exits and the substitution table stable_var_41C has been nicely 
scrambled and is ready for use. 
 
At this point, the actual process of decryption is performed.  DarkComet iterates through its decryption loop once for each 
byte in the encrypted source message (after conversion from ASCII to integer representation.)  The decryption loop 
performs the following two steps: 
 
First, it performs an additional scrambling operation on the substitution table stable_var_41C by swapping two 
elements.  When processing the k
stable_var_41C; it uses another accumulator variable, implemented by register EDI, to choose the second element of 
the swap pair: 
 

th source byte, the first element of the swap pair is always the k+1

th element of table

th) source byte to produced a decrypted character. 

After performing this swap operation, DarkComet finally decrypts a byte of message.  It sums up the values of the two 
swapped elements (at instruction 0x0044C85F), then uses the result (modulo 256) to re-index into the 
stable_var_41C table to pull out a third element (at instruction 0x0044C874).  This third element is XORed against 
the current (k
 
It should be pointed out that conceptually, this decryption mechanism - both the manner in which the substitution table is 
built, as well as how it is used for XOR-based decryption - is very similar to that used by the Trojan.PonyDOS malware 
family.  The actual implementation has quite a few differences, but the basic encryption algorithm is the same.  
Trojan.PonyDOS, however, adds a few additional layers to secure its communications protocol above and beyond the core 
crypto algorithm which it shares with DarkComet; specifically, the computation of some cryptographic hashes.  Also, 
Trojan.PonyDOS does not go to the trouble of converting its encrypted data payloads into ASCII representations as 
DarkComet does. 
 
Now that we've reversed the core DarkComet decryption mechanism (needed to read C&C commands), we'll want to 
confirm that the encryption mechanism (needed to read and/or fake bot phone home messages) is symmetric.  And indeed, 
by following references to the socket handle used to recv() the initial C&C command, we can trace through to find the 
encryption routine called by DarkComet just prior to send()ing back its response messages.  Sure enough, the encryption 
routine, Encrypt_sub_44C34C(), is functionally identical to the decryption routine, as hoped and expected; the only 
difference being that the Integerize_sub_44C1C0() routine prior to decryption is absent, and a new routine, which 
we'll call Integer2String_sub_409C6C(), is called following the encryption step; this routine simply converts the 
raw encrypted data back into the ASCII version of its hexadecimal values. 
 
Of course, in order to have a fully functional implementation of DarkComet's crypto system, we'll need to know what key 
strings it uses.  We see that there are two locations where DecryptCommandBuffer_sub_44C628() is called, and 
one of those locations, EncryptData_sub_49D9EC(), has a hard-coded string with an uncanny resemblance to a 
decryption key: 
 

Arbor Networks  |  18 
 

Figure 16.  Function EncryptData_sub_49D9EC() 

 

 

 

We see that the decryption string key_var_10, passed to DecryptCommandBuffer_sub_44C628() via EDX, is 
formed by concatenating a hard-coded string #KCMDDC42F#- with some mystery string stored at [EBX+8].  It turns out 
that this mysterious value stored at an offset from EBX is passed into EncryptData_sub_49D9EC() via the EAX 
register.  Tracing backwards up the stack, we follow the reference to EAX as the baton is passed from register to register.  It 
does not take long to come across the following routine, which we will label ComputeKeySuffix_sub_48F52C(): 
 

Arbor Networks  |  19 
 

Arbor Networks  |  20 
 

 

Figure 17.  Function ComputeKeySuffix_sub_48F52C() 

 

 

You don't run into code like this very often.  It receives an output buffer passed via EAX.  It then uses register EBX to do 
some rather "inefficient" operations.  First, it assigns EBX the value 0xFFFFFF8F, or -71.  It then adds 1000 to EBX, 
yielding 887.  Then it goes through four iterations of a loop that has no purpose other than to increment EBX by one on 
each iteration, resulting in a value of 891.  Finally, it completes its laborious calculations by decrementing EBX by one, 
yielding a final answer of 890. This integer is passed to a standard integer-to-string API, which writes the string 890 into 
the output buffer.  In C, these shenanigans would look something like the following: 
 

int nAddend = 1000; 
int nSuffix = -71; 
int nResult = nSuffix + nAddend; 
for (int k=0; k<4; k++) 
    nResult += 1; 
sprintf(suffix, "%d", --nResult); 

 
This is a very roundabout way of assigning the hard-coded string 890 to a buffer.  Clearly the DarkComet author is 
(wisely) trying to avoid having the entire decryption key string hard-coded in the bot executable. 
 
So at this point, we know that the decryption key is composed of the prefix #KCMDDC42F#- concatenated with the suffix 
890, yielding #KCMDDC42F#-890. 
 
One final note regarding the encryption key strings used by DarkComet: as first documented in  
Contextis' Laura Aylward's DarkComet analysis, each version of DarkComet uses a different hard-coded string for the key 
prefix.  For example, we have observed the following: 
 
 

Dark Comet version 
Version 4.0 
Version 4.2 

Crypto Key Prefix (Default) 
#KCMDDC4#-890 
#KCMDDC42F#-890 

Arbor Networks  |  21 
 

Version 5.0 

#KCMDDC5#-890 

 

Figure 18.  Standard crypto key prefixes for DarkComet versions 

 
Furthermore, and also documented by Contextis, DarkComet supports the use of an optional password that is appended to 
the default (version-specific) crypto key.  For example, the default password (if enabled) string is 0123456789.  This 10-
digit string will be appended to the standard crypto key #KCMDDC42F#-890 (in the case of DarkComet version 4.2) to 
yield a final key of #KCMDDC42F#-8900123456789.  The code that performs this concatenation is found in a routine 
we'll call FormCryptoKey_sub_49D2F4(): 
 

Figure 19.  Function FormCryptoKey_sub_49D2F4() 

 

 

Arbor Networks  |  22 
 

 
This code concatenates the three components of the final crypto key: the hard-coded prefix (e.g., #KCMDDC42F#-), the 
three-digit string 890 that is not technically hard-coded but deterministically computed using the aforementioned 
ComputeKeySuffix_sub_48F52C() routine, and the optional botnet password stored in the global variable 
PWD_off_4A4B84. 
 
The password itself is actually stored as an encrypted resource.  Upon initialization, it is decrypted using a preliminary 
crypto key comprised only of the first two components (e.g., #KCMDDC42F#-890) using a routine we've labeled 
DecryptResource_sub_49D9EC().  To make a long story short, this routine uses the Windows APIs 
FindResource(), LoadResource(), etc. to extract a named resource of type RT_RCDATA (code 0x0A), intended 
for "application-defined resources (raw data)".  The raw data is then decrypted using the preliminary crypto key. 
 
In the case of the crypto password, the name of the resource is PWD.  The resource is extracted, decrypted, and stored for 
future use in the global variable PWD_off_4A4B84 by a function we call DecryptResources_sub_49F92C():

In the case of the default password 0123456789, the encrypted resource will hold the value 
6811E636E69E9AEFA5C6.  This DecryptResources_sub_49F92C() function actually decrypts a lot of 
encrypted bot parameters stored in various resources; some of the more interesting ones are as follows:

Of particular interest is the encrypted NETDATA resource, which holds the C&C hostname and port.  The Resource Hacker 
tool is a great utility for viewing and extracting the various DarkComet encrypted parameters:

So to summarize, DarkComet uses a hard-coded (although different for each version) preliminary key string, such as 
#KCMDDC42F#-890, to decrypt its sensitive parameters from various raw resources - such as the C&C information and 
communications password stored in the NETDATA and PWD resources, respectively.  It then appends the decrypted comms 
password (stored in the PWD resource) to the end of the preliminary crypto key string to form the final key, 
#KCMDDC42F#-8900123456789, that it uses for securing the network traffic to and from its C&C server.

Applying our DarkComet encryption module against the observed traffic results in the following:

Likewise, when a DarkComet C&C issues attacks command, the encrypted traffic on the wire looks like these examples: 
 
185CB63BBE0EA3DF6D2A725936265160E391BC77F47FF46A3934CFB173AC

185CB63BA31EA7C967297252432E5A7CFC96B261EB7EF4742533CEBF37A9C081 
185CB63BA503B9C967297252432E5A7CFC96B261EB7EF4742533CEBF37A9C081 
 
But applying the decryption routine yields the following: 
 
DDOSHTTPFLOOD192.168.100.254|5 
DDOSUDPFLOOD192.168.100.254:80|5 
DDOSSYNFLOOD192.168.100.254:80|5 
 
Which corresponds to ordering an HTTP flood, a UDP flood, and a TCP flood, respectively, against target 
192.168.100.254, with each attack lasting for 5 seconds.  Once the attacks are completed the DarkComet bot will 
respond with an encrypted status message such as the following: 
 
1E4CAB2DA50FBBDB781F5336347B073DA9DCD936B46EB03B646DDAE366F7D5C76D3C0420A55906F524
240A0F34D3A6384150 
 
Which decrypts to the following: 
 
BTRESULTSyn Flood|Syn task finished!|Administrator 
 
As implied above, DarkComet supports three types of DDoS attacks: HTTP flooding, UDP flooding, and TCP flooding 
(mis-advertised as "SYNFLOOD").  The UDP and TCP volumetric floods are quite unremarkable and simply consist of 
random gibberish blasted at a target host and port.  The HTTP flood also appears to be intended as a rudimentary GET 
flood with a minimalist HTTP request header.  However, DarkComet's HTTP flood implementation happens to have not 
one, but two catastrophic bugs. 
 
First of all, the thread procedure that implements the DDOSHTTPFLOOD attack command, SendHttp_sub_485848(), 
uses the WinSock2 library's socket(), connect(), and send() APIs to send the following hard-coded HTTP 
flooding request: 
 
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n 

Arbor Networks  |  29 
 

 
At first glance, this looks like an (almost) valid, although minimalist, HTTP request that is terminated with a double 
carriage-return/line-feed (CRLF) combination.  However, when one takes a closer look at the way DarkComet stores this 
string, we see that the \r and \n characters are not actually CR (0x0D) and LF (0x0A) bytes.  Instead, they are literally 
comprised of the backslash (0x2F), letter r (0x72), and letter n (0x6E) bytes!

Figure 25.  Hard-coded HTTP request string HttpRequest_byte_485970 

 

If the HTTP request string had been encoded properly (ending with 0x0D0A0D0A), the length of the string would have 
been 18.  But instead, we see that it is 22 bytes in length.  Due to this, DarkComet's attempt at an application layer attack is 
not close to a valid HTTP request per the RFCs. 
 
The second big mistake in the implementation of DarkComet's HTTP flood attack becomes apparent further down in the 
attack thread code, just before the (buggy) HTTP request payload is sent to the target via the send() API:

Figure 26.  Function EncryptAndSendData_sub_49393C() 

 
Unbelievably, DarkComet bot is accidentally encrypting the (buggy) GET request string at instruction 0x00493972 via a 
call to the already-reversed Encrypt_sub_44C34C() routine.  The resulting (encrypted) HTTP request is then sent on 
its merry way to the DDoS target via the send() API call at instruction 0x0049399D. 
 
So the target web server ends up receiving gibberish instead of a well-formed HTTP request that might exhaust resources 
at the application layer.  Due to these two serious flaws, DarkComet's HTTP flood attack reduces down to nothing more 
than a volumetric TCP flood against port 80, and a very weak one at that (a mere 22 bytes of TCP payload per flooding 
packet...)  In fact, here is what the actual "HTTP flooding" traffic looks like: 
 

1B5DAD48D97ABFDB7F3612275C26342091CED63D8620 
1B5DAD48D97ABFDB7F3612275C26342091CED63D8620 
1B5DAD48D97ABFDB7F3612275C26342091CED63D8620 

 
Clearly, this is very unlikely to bring any web server to its knees!
