Fidelis Threat Advisory #1007 
RECOVERING FROM SHAMOON 

 
 

November 1, 2012

Executive Summary 
The Shamoon malware has received considerable coverage in the past couple of months 
because of its destructive nature. Despite assertions that it is the work of amateurs, it has had a 
major impact on companies believed to have been affected. The basic functions of the malware 
are to infect, entrench, propagate, and wipe.  
However because of the way the malware operates and how it is programmed to wipe, it can find 
itself being its own enemy. It will wipe data found in the Documents and Settings folder and the 
System32 folder, and then use a signed driver for disk access to start wiping at the disk level. 
Because the operating system needs certain files in the System32 folder to run, it was found that 
infected hosts will always restart before the malware can wipe completely at the disk level.  
Due to this it was possible to make a complete recovery of Shamoon-infected file systems to the 
state they were in before the wiping made the OS unbootable and unreadable. In fact the majority 
of files outside of the System32 and Document and Settings folder are recoverable as well; this 
provided the opportunity for a successful and fruitful analysis, investigation, and remediation 
effort.  
Threat Overview 
According to community write-ups, the Shamoon malware appears to have been deployed 
against a couple of entities on or about August 15, 2012. The malware had self-propagating 
qualities and was designed to overwrite data on disks attached to or accessible from targeted 
systems. The malware’s functionality, briefly summarized below, was covered in some detail in 
community postings, such as Kaspersky’s Securelist blog. Analysis details and testing of an 
available sample of Shamoon by General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions researchers 
revealed that the malware’s wipe operations did not overwrite entire disks, but rather overwrote 
enough to prevent access to the affected file systems, along with substantial amounts of file data. 
However, analysis indicated that some files were still intact after the malware’s write operations 
and subsequent system reboot.

Fidelis researchers surmised there might be a means of recovering file data from targeted 
systems from a forensic and investigative analysis point of view. With this goal in mind, 
researchers tested several possible ways of restoring disk data critical to the access of the 
targeted disk’s file system. What follows is a brief description of what the sample of the Shamoon 
malware does and a description and results of researchers’ file system recovery efforts. 
Shamoon Wiper Functionality Actions: 

-­‐  Executes a copy of itself as a scheduled job 
-­‐  Deletes the file created for the scheduled job 
-­‐  Entrenches itself as a service 
-­‐  Execution of the entrenched file results in a dropped driver 
-­‐ 
-­‐ 
-­‐ 

The dropped driver is loaded and executed 
The dropped driver facilitates disk access 
The malware overwrites disk data to include the contents of \\Documents and Settings 
(user data) and \\Windows\system32 (system data) directories 
The malware eventually overwrites the disk’s boot records (Master Boot Record (MBR) 
and Volume Boot Record (VBR)) (Note: Testing was accomplished on disks with one 
partition) 
The malware appears to target user data first, then system data 
The nature of the overwrites is such that the malware writes only a certain amount of data 
to targeted files, starting at the files’ beginning (Offset 0x0) and then writing a certain 
amount of data to other file locations 
Fidelis researcher observations included the following: 

-­‐ 

-­‐ 
-­‐ 

-­‐ 

o  At some point during the writing (wiping) process, the targeted system tries to 
read file data that has been overwritten, prompting an attempt to restore the 
involved file 

o  The system asks the user for media containing system files when it cannot find 

o  The targeted system eventually reboots, resulting an error on restart because of 

the system files it is looking for 

the overwritten boot records 

o  The disks targeted in testing were not completely overwritten; there was still 

apparently viable file data on the targeted disks 

o  The result of the malware’s operation was the prevention of accessing the 

targeted file system 

Note: The Shamoon sample Fidelis researchers had available looked very similar to that detailed 
in community write-ups. However, as of the date of publication, researchers were still analyzing 
the available sample. Therefore, differences between the available sample and others available 
to the community may become apparent in the future.  
Analysis and Testing Overview 
Fidelis initially approached the Shamoon analysis strictly from a perspective of determining what 
forensic artifacts could be recovered from a targeted system. The goal was at least a partial

reconstruction of the events precipitating the Shamoon attack, and possibly using those events 
found on the targeted systems to determine a start of the attack, and a possible source. Analysis 
revealed the possibility that some user data would be recovered as a side benefit to the forensic 
analysis process. 
Three types of operating systems were used for testing purposes; all testing occurred on laptops. 
The laptops were wiped, had the operating system installed, and then had the Shamoon malware 
executed on the system. The three operating systems used for testing were Windows XP, 
Windows 2003, and Windows 7. The malware executed with no issues except on Windows 7. 
The User Access Control (UAC) on the Windows 7 systems had to be turned off before the 
malware would execute and perform the wiping action as has been observed on other machines. 
This has been noted by others in the community as well, specifically that Administrator access is 
needed for initially launching Shamoon.  
Shamoon operation results in much of the data on the affected systems being overwritten with the 
fragmented image of a burning flag. As has been detailed above, the wipe function will overwrite 
data within the Documents and Settings folder followed by the System32 folder, and then it will 
start the physical disk access and start the wiping at the disk level. If the system restarts before 
the malware has completed wiping the disk then much of the data can still be recovered: each of 
our tests showed the system did restart before the disk was completely wiped. The amount wiped 
from the host will never be the same from system to system, mainly because the size of the disk 
and partitions will all need to be taken into account.  
VBR and File System Recovery Strategies 
The following is the view of the wiped disk for each of the operating systems that we tested:

Figure 1 was found at the MBR (Sector 0) and the VBR (Sector 63/56 (XP, 2003), and 
2048/206848 (7)) of each of the operating systems (As well as throughout the drive). Fidelis

researchers decided to look further into the drive and find if there was any possibility of recovering 
files or logs that would help illuminate what happened to the systems, and if any artifacts of the 
malware could be recovered.   
Note on the VBR: VBR stands for Volume Boot Record, and is made up of the boot sector and 
bootstrap code. The boot sector takes up 1 sector on the drive; the next 6 sectors on the drive are 
allocated for the bootstrap code. In all 16 sectors are allocated in total for the VBR. The VBR is 
created when a file system is created on a partition. In this paper we will be covering the NTFS 
Boot Record. The VBR is used to load machine code into RAM to start a program. Normally this 
program is the operating system.  
Keyword searches revealed that there were still files that would be recoverable on the system. In 
particular it was found that registry files and headers were still on the disk. After this, it was found 
that the Master File Table (MFT) was still, for the most part, intact. Trying to avoid the long and 
laborious process of carving files from the disk, researchers decided that it would instead be 
worth the time to try and recover the file system.  
When the Windows operating system is installed or an NTFS volume created, a backup copy of 
the VBR is written to the last sector of the volume. This is a very important detail, as the forensic 
value of the VBR is substantial (See Figure 2). The area that will contain the critical information is 
known as the Bios Parameter Block (BPB).  With this information it is possible to rebuild the file 
system as it existed before the wipe.

Just because the boot sector of the VBR is recoverable doesn’t mean that everything on the file 
system will be restored to normal. If a file was wiped by the malware then it will still be wiped, or 
partially wiped. However files that weren’t wiped will be much easier and faster to recover then 
carving and the context of each file will be easy to interpret.  
To recover or identify the backup VBR a search will need to be run across the image file. It is 
preferable if the image file is a raw image as they are easier to edit then other image file formats. 
The search was performed for the hex of the VBR file header, EB 52 90 4E 54 46 53 (ëR(cid:0)NTFS). 
A few hits were found throughout the drive, and it appeared that there were multiple empty VBR 
templates throughout the system (Shown in Figure 3). The correct VBR will likely be the one with 
information filled in from offset 10 – 80 (See Figure 2 to breakdown). During testing it was found 
that the last hit was normally the correct VBR, as this would be the VBR found at the end of the 
volume.

Note: On 2003 systems the boot backup is sometimes found halfway through the partition, a 
manual parsing of the file will need to be performed to confirm the VBR is legitimate for the 
partition. 
Once the VBR was found we noted the offset and calculated the sector to locate the backup in 
our desired forensic program. For the purposes of testing we used EnCase (v6.19.6). Once the 
sector of the backup VBR is known, EnCase was started and the image of the infected system 
was loaded. Within disk view we located the backup VBR and right clicked to add a manual 
partition as an NTFS file system. The partition was added, the MFT read, and the file system 
appeared:

Fig 4. File system recovered within EnCase.  

With the file system restored some relevant artifacts can be located now, and an actual computer 
forensic examination can take place.  
This recovery can be successful without the use of the EnCase suite of forensic software as well. 
Using a hex editor of your choice to repair the image, in our testing WinHex (16.6) was used. Find 
the file header of the backup VBR within a file editor, copy from the header to footer of the boot 
sector; the footer will always be 55 AA.  The size will be 512 bytes from header to footer. Then 
depending on what operating system is being examined you can write the copied boot sector to 
the appropriate sector on the affected image.  
Placing the boot sector into the correct location will be the trickiest part as incorrect placement will 
result in the file system not being recognized. The boot sector should be placed at sector 63/56 
for XP/2003, and at sector 2048/206848 for Windows 7. After this is complete you will be able to 
add the image into the forensic program. If the file system is not recognized then it is possible that 
the MBR will need to be reconstructed, though this is unlikely. Before rebuilding the MBR try 
adding the image as a volume and not as a disk.  
Note: Other recovery techniques are certainly viable as well. There are automated partition 
rebuilding tools available, though some of these rely on a valid MBR to work properly (In this case 
that wouldn’t be feasible). Other options would be the fixboot command from the Windows 
Recovery Console found on a Windows OS disk. What we have presented here are forensically 
sound methods that are easily repeatable and least damaging to the evidence/image. 
Multiple Partition Recovery Strategies 
For testing purposes the system with Windows 2003 was set up with three different partitions. We 
wanted to emulate the situation in which one would have multiple partitions on the computers, as 
is quite common. Conceivably the malware should wipe all of these partitions as well, as has 
been seen within the code of the malware. What we wanted to look at was the extent of the 
wiping on the partitions and whether the same techniques that were applied to a single partitioned 
drive would still apply on the multiple partitioned drive.  
In theory each partition should be recoverable, as non-bootable partitions still create a VBR and 
place the backup at the end of the partition when a NTFS file system is installed. After searching

through the drive we found that there were three VBRs that all seemed to have corresponding 
information for the partitions that were originally created. On our test system we found that 
EnCase was not adding the partitions in a way that would recognize the file system as it did for 
the other systems. This could be because our boot sector was at sector 56 and not 63, or 
because the multiple partitions clash when trying to add them in.  
We ended up having to edit the image by adding the backup boot sectors into the correct sector 
where the originals were found.

Note: The VBR placement for the next partition starts after the backup VBR of the preceding 
partition.  
Once the VBRs were added correctly we proceeded to add the partitions into EnCase.

Note: EnCase gives default volume labels when added, so C, D, and E are respectively 1, 2, and 
3.  
The extent of the wiping appeared to be on the same level to what was found on single 
partitioned drives. As mentioned before this was to be expected as the malware tries to wipe 
mounted and other volumes first and will then move to the primary volume (1/C).

The Fidelis Take 
Fidelis researchers have developed a set of rules for detecting the Shamoon malware along the 
entire threat life cycle: initial infection, lateral propagation, and command and control 
communication. The embedded malware detection engine also recognizes the variant of 
Shamoon malware analyzed. All sensor configurations are capable of detecting the initial infection 
and the command and control communication, and the Fidelis XPS Internal Sensor is required for 
detecting the lateral movement of the malicious program.
