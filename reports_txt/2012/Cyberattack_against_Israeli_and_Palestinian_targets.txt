Summary 
We have observed multiple probable malware attacks against Israeli and Palestinian targets. 
These attacks are likely performed by the same attacker, as the malware in question 
communicate with the same command- and control structures, and in many cases are signed 
using the same digital certificate.  

These attacks have been ongoing for at least a year; seemingly first focused on Palestinians, 
then Israelis. The attacker is unknown at this point, but the purpose is assumed to be 
espionage/surveillance.

Introduction 

 
Recently, media (1) reported of a targeted attack against the Israeli government, in the form of 
emails purporting to come from IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz with a malicious attachment. 

This was an interesting development – Israel has, as far as we know, not been very targeted by 
spear phishing attacks like this.  

In the following text we will usually be referring to the actual malware files we uncovered by 
their MD5 hash, which is a number that uniquely (well, uniquely enough) identifies the file in 
question.

The initial reported malware 

While we don’t have visibility into Israeli government mails, we do receive a lot of suspicious 
executable files, and a little digging gives results.  We found one file which matched the reports: 

"IDF strikes militants in Gaza Strip following rocket barrage.doc----------------------------------------------.scr". 

This is an executable file, but the icon looks like a document icon, and the very long name makes 
the *.scr extension hard to spot - particularly if the executable comes packaged in an archive, as 
was reportedly the case here. 

 

This executable itself is a WinRAR selfextracting (SFX) archive, which contains several other files: 

•  Word.exe, an XtremeRat backdoor executable 
•  2.ico, an icon file 
•  barrage.doc, an innocent document containing pictures (above) 

XtremeRat is a commercially available backdoor trojan which has been used in many attacks, 
targeted and otherwise, over the years. It gained some notoriety in connection with attacks 
against Syrian activists; along with other off-the-shelf trojans such as BlackShades and 
DarkComet.

The digital signature 

An interesting feature of this exact XtremeRat is that it is digitally signed – seemingly by 
Microsoft: 

 

 
The certificate chain ends in an untrusted (faked) root certificate; so it will not validate properly. 
Nevertheless the certificate is useful for us, as it can be used to find related cases. All 
certificates are issued with a serial number which normally is quite unique, as it is supposed to 
be an identifier within the scope of its issuer. So, querying our databases for this particular 
faked certificate returns a number of files which are probably the products of our Israel-hostile 
attacker. 

These files were received in intervals through the fall and summer, going back to May 2012, and 
reveal more hints about targets. Several of them are self extracting archives containing extra 
files, such as documents, links and even video. The following pages display some of the bait 
information the new files contain.

Command & Control 

The involved malwares connect to external hosts controlled by the attackers. These belong to 
various DynDNS services, and at the time of writing resolve to IP addresses located with hosting 
services in the US. 
 

 
Samples in yellow connecting to C&C hosts (green). All are digitally signed and connected 
through the blue certificate node in the middle. 

 

This is where the trail could have ended. However, there are still clues to look at – for example, 
what other executables connect to these C&C hosts. This time, digging into our Malware 
Analyzer G2 (MAG2) databases shows that there is more malware talking to this infrastructure, 
and these bots again connect to more C&C domains.  These new malwares are also 
predominantly XtremeRats. However, they have been in circulation for a longer time – all the 
way back to October 2011. I think it is logical to assume that all these have been part of a 
medium/large surveillance operation.

When updated with this information the plot now looks like this: 

Same as previous illustration, where new unsigned samples are shown to be related through the 
usage of the same C&C infrastructure.Colours have changed – now the certificate is green, the 
C&C servers are yellow, the samples are blue, while IP addresses are purple. These IP addresses 
can be considered examples – they change regularly. 

 
Several of these domains appear to be hosted together. For example (at the time of writing): 

 

108.171.108.190 is pointed to by may2008.dyndns.info, menu.dyndns.biz, flashsoft.no-ip.biz, 
monagameel.chickenkiller.com, powerhost.zapto.org 
108.171.124.13 is pointed to by helpme.no-ip.biz, mjed10.no-ip.info 
69.80.101.244 is pointed to by good.zapto.org, hint.zapto.org, hint1.zapto.org, natco1.no-ip.net, 
natco2.no-ip.net, natco3.no-ip.net, natco4.no-ip.net, loading.myftp.org, skype.servemp3.com, 
test.cable-modem.org  

 

 

These addresses tend to change. Typically, every couple of days a new IP configuration is 
introduced for some boxes, while others may remain static – such as the host lokia.mine.nu, 
which has resolved to 69.80.107.129 since we started examining the case. 

As mentioned, the IP addresses in use have belonged to mostly US-based hosting services…at 
least recently.

If we go further back in time (towards spring of 2012) most of the domains used resolved to IP 
addresses in the range 188.161.*.  This range is located in Gaza and belongs to a provider 
headquartered in Ramallah in the West Bank: 

Palestinian Territory, Occupied Gaza Palestine Telecommunications Company (paltel), ASN: 
AS12975  
 
We have also to a lesser extent seen IP addresses in use belonging to another Paltel division: 
Palestinian Territory, Occupied Gaza Hadara Technologies Private Shareholding Company, 
ASN: AS15975 

What is behind these IP addresses is hard to establish. It is possible that they are hacked boxes, 
and as such not give much valid information. If that were the case, one might have expected 
greater IP range and geographical distribution, but nothing is certain. 

Our databases also show that there is much more malware talking to these providers through 
many other DynDNS domains. Some of these are probably also related to this case, but as we 
have no evidence linking the cases, these malwares have not been included in this paper. It is 
however interesting to note the hostnames some of these connect to – like “terroristttt.no-
ip.biz”.

The plot thickens 
So far, the impression is of an attack actor attempting to gather information from Israelis. Then 
something happens that throws this picture in disarray. 

A series of samples show up that do not follow the pattern. They apparently do not target 
Israelis. Instead they use Arabic language and refer to Palestinian issues.

This document in Arabic claims that Mahmoud Abbas is threatened by assassination by Mossad 
if he does not stop his reconciliation policy towards Hamas. The image is taken from a news 
story about Abbas speaking at a meeting in Ramallah.

The sample containing this video is digitally signed in the same way as the initial samples, but 
the baiting angle is different. Instead of showing information interesting for an Israeli audience, 
the video contains a music piece critical of Mahmoud Abbas, claiming that he is not working for 
the good of the Palestinian people.

This document revolves around the prisoner exchange deal with the Israeli government over the 
Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, held hostage by Hamas for over five years.

This image appears purportedly to be of Gilad Shalit in his hostage cell. This could be aimed at 
Israelis, but the image itself has been mostly shown on Arabic/Palestinian sites like 
www.shehab.ps, a news agency located in Gaza.

We also see attacks apparently against Palestinian targets without being able to tie them up 
against the already mentioned attack/C&C structure. For example, a file received by us as 
“d.exe”, (MD5 1f1e9958440d773c34415d9eb6334b25), found in Palestine Nov 17th last year, 
shows a PDF document with content seemingly taken from “Palestine Now” 
(www.paltimes.net):

Document metadata 
Most of the bait attachments are Word documents, and Word documents can contain metadata 
(typically the usernames of the creator and the one who last saved the document). It is possible 
to scrub these details, but our attackers seem to have forgotten this – or inserted faked data.

There seems to be a number of people involved in creating these bait files. The dates also 
roughly coincide with the apparent shift in IP ranges (Appendix B), from first being located in 
Gaza, to being located internationally.

Conclusion 
We have uncovered a substantial number of malware executables that contain information 
seemingly tailored at Israelis and Palestinians. We have the impression that a cybersurveillance 
operation is underway (and is probably still ongoing - most recent sample created Oct. 31) 
which was first mainly focused on Palestinian targets, then shifted towards Israel. The reason 
for the shift is unknown. Maybe it was planned all along; or caused by changes in the political 
climate; or maybe the first half of the operation found data that caused the target change. 

This analysis is almost exclusively based on the executable files themselves. We have very little 
information about actual infections. The only documented case is the Benny Gantz-themed 
email which triggered the investigation. We consider it likely that other attacks have been 
modeled the same way, using attachments in email. These attachments may often have 
consisted of the described malicious files inside archives like RAR or ZIP. 

The attacker is still unknown to us. There are probably several actors that could have an interest 
in the regional politics, as the various powerblocks in the region are manifold and conflicted. By 
using largely off-the-shelf malware, the cost of mounting such an operation is considerably 
lower than for those who do their own malware development.

The likelihood that there are more names involved is large. There is for example a domain 
natco5.no-ip.net which resolves to the same IP’s as the rest of the series, but we have not seen 
the malware which uses it – yet.
