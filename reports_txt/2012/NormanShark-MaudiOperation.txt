Introduction 

Maudi is a series of small malwares that share similar configuration and behaviour. The naming of this family has not 
been very established, but some samples are detected by some vendors as Maudi or PoisonIvy. This is partly accurate as 
Maudi trojans in almost all cases install the well known PoisonIvy remote access trojan. 

These malwares are not particularly new - they have been in circulation for a long time, probably going back to at least 
2009. Still, they provide a backdrop to other attacks that is interesting. 

 

Behaviour 

The malware itself is not very complex. These are small installers that create two files – one library (typically called 
msacm32.drv, ntshrui.dll or wdmaud.drv) in the Windows folder, and a raw PoisonIvy shellcode blob called user.dat, 
user.db, temp.db or something along those lines. The installer then spawns explorer.exe, which then automatically loads 
the malicious library through a mechanism called DLL hijacking aka DLL preloading (1).  There are innocent libraries with 
the same names in the Windows System folder, but since the malicious libraries are placed in the Windows folder, they 
sneak in the queue and Explorer loads them first. 

The malicious library then reads and directly calls the PoisonIvy code in user.dat, which establishes an encrypted 
communication with the configured C&C server.  

When communication is established, the attacker has unauthorized access to the computer.

Configuration 

 

PoisonIvy code blobs are preconfigured in the PoisonIvy builder program to contain information about which Command 
& Control server to contact, which port to establish connection on, and various other parameters. 
 

The PoisonIvy builder 

 

 

The Maudi PoisonIvy droppers contain their own small xor-encoded configuration block which overrides the default 
settings stored in the PoisonIvy blob. This usually contains the name of the C&C server, port and what corresponds to the 
PoisonIvy profile ID.  

Example Maudi configuration: 

171088046.gnway.org 

Profile ID: xfish  
C&C: 
port:   0x0D84 = 3460 
 

 

The ID xfish is used in many of these malwares and may be a default value, but there are many others in use.

PoisonIvy uses the Camellia 256-bit block cipher for its encrypted communication. The password for this communication 
is usually hardcoded in the malware itself; the default value used by the builder is “admin”. 

The passwords used by Maudi droppers vary. Sometimes the default value is used, other times the password is set to 
longer strings. There seems to be an affinity for passwords of length 11 (0x0b). A few are shown below.

Certificates 

The interesting bit with these trojans is that practically all of them are digitally signed using self-made test certficates. 
These certificates vary somewhat, but most contain the recognizable string “WWW.CeleWare.NET” or 
“WWW.AeleWare.NET” in their Organizational Unit (OU) section.  The CeleWare strings are default values left by the free 
code signing tool CeleSign.exe from Yonsm.NET.  

Though the tool itself seems innocent enough, many files signed by it are malicious. 

 

 

 

There were a number of different such certificates, and it may be that the varying certificates denote different 
campaigns, projects or other contexts – for example, all samples we have seen signed “DataBase@Hotmail.com” are 
droppers that install Maudi components signed “MogolSoft@Hotmail.com” or “SoftSign@HotMail.com”.

Stolen certificates 

Though by far most of these malwares use test certificates, not all follow this pattern. A few are not signed at all, and in 
two cases we have seen the use of a stolen certificate. 

The certificate in question belongs to YNK Japan Inc. 

 

This is the configuration block from one of the YNK-signed Maudi samples. C&C is p.hannmaill.net, port is 3460 (0xD84), 
and tag is xfish.  

These two trojans are configured to connect to p.hannmaill.net and s.hiinet.net, respectively. These domains appear 
registered by the same entity (sofoxman@gmail.com). 

Both the domains and the certificate have been connected to targeted attack campaigns before.

Infrastructure 

 

By combining certificates and command&control infrastructure we can construct a partial image of this malware 
operation 

 

 

Note: A high-resolution version of this graphic is appended to this report. 

 
In this diagram the samples are organized in clusters signed similarly. What quickly becomes obvious is that most of the 
samples are connected; either they use the same certificate, or their certificate cluster is connected with other clusters 
through common Command&Control servers. Some clusters (shown at the lower right and left side) seem unconnected 
beyond the fact that they use the same malware. 

The Command&Control servers used are in many cases organized through well-known dynamic DNS providers such as 
3322.org, zapto.org and so on, but there are also a few seemingly directly registered second level domains. A full list of 
these is provided in the appendix.

Targeting 

 

Local Chinese interests and human rights activists 

We do not have extensive data on which targets have been exposed to Maudi malware, but we have some examples 
which give decent hints.  Some Maudi droppers display images, like the ones below: 

This picture was widely distributed in 2009, and allegedly showed results of violence during an Uighur riot. However, it 
was later reported to be taken from a car accident. 

 

This picture from Xinhuanet is reportedly from the 2008 riots in Lhasa, Tibet.

          N o r m a n   S h a r k

 

 

 
These are classic examples of decoys used in targeted campaigns against activists working for the rights of ethnic 
minorities within the Chinese borders. 
 
Other decoy documents contain small messages in Chinese; and Chinese name listings. 

This gives the general impression that this family is used mostly against domestic Chinese targets and human rights 
activists. Other research has confirmed this impression. In his 2010 article “Human Rights and Malware Attacks” (2), 
security researcher Nart Villeneuve documents the use of Maudi as the downloaded payload of spearphishing attacks.  
 
The initial payload in that case was a mail attachment, an exploited PDF file (readme.pdf, md5 
72bdca7dd12ed04b21dfa60c5c2ab6c4) which downloaded and decoded an encoded blob (md5 
ec16143a14c091100e7af30de03fce1f) from the site www.humanright-watch.org, not to be confused with the legitimate 
Human Rights’ Watch website hrw.org. 

The decoded file was a Maudi dropper, self-signed using the name “soft@hotmail.com”, and the dropped component 
belonged to the “JinDiQIAO@hotmail.com”-signed cluster. 

 

Mongolia 

There are hints at other targets as well. A group of Maudis use domain names and other strings that seem to indicate a 
focus on a specific region, namely Mongolia. 

Mongolia is an interesting country. It is democratic with a multi-party system, and has a market-driven economy. It is 
squeezed between two very powerful nations – Russia to the North and China to the South. It is also a country rich on 
geological natural resources. 

The initial hints about this targeting are vague. Some of the Maudi samples are signed using self-signed certificate issued 
to “mogolsoft@hotmail.com”.  Others use the Command & Control domain “mol-goverment.com”. This domain was 
registered by a known targeted attack actor, hlemonk@163.com, who has registered a string of other malware-
connected domains – among others goodmongol.com. 

However, when looking more closely, more solid ties to Mongolian targets can be found. The Maudi domain 
bodologetee.com (registered by the email entity mongolianews@yahoo.com) can be documented used in other attacks 
on apparent Mongolian targets. 

For example, the malware dropper cc1a806d25982acdb35dd196ab8171bc, a WinRAR SFX executable installed through 
the use of the Word exploit CVE-2012-0158, contained a PlugX component configured to connect to 
ppt.bodologetee.com. This is documented in the Norman Shark blog post “The Chinese Malware Complexes: PlugX Used 
against Mongolian Targets”. (3)

Connections to other attacks 

 

Indirectly, we see that the Maudi infrastructure shares parameters with several well known targeted attack campaigns. 

 

o qwer.wekby.com - domain 

Three samples connect to qwer.wekby.com, known from the RSA breach in 2011 (4).  These samples are (md5, profile ID): 

28b5241ca13603636dbf626792231161, qwerw 

6a83dc3f53079e17ecc49cbc0dacc8f5, qwerw 

cf45dbdb3718b4b728c2dd894032464b, qwerw 

 

The malwares used in the RSA intrusion itself were also PoisonIvy, though used a different dropper mechanism and were 
signed using a different digital certificate. 

o jeno_1980@hotmail.com – domain registration 

Two samples connect to ns2.adultstick.com. This domain was registered by jeno_1980@hotmail.com, an email address 
also used to register domains used both in the Mirage (5) and Sin Digoo (6) malware campaigns.  

7d36ad6aafbf1f9496ccc6ac1a8bb57e, Irqdz 
64718689ee3ff695c55ea1ec213434d1, Irqdz 
 

o enbtcd@yahoo.com.co – domain registration 

Some Maudi samples connect to windows-liveupdate.com or windowsliveupdatecache.com, domains registered by the 
entity enbtcd@yahoo.com.co. This address has also registered domains used in Briba (aka c0d0so0) malware, which has 
been used for many targeted attacks.

o hlemonk@163.com - domain registration 

This address was used to register the Maudi domains mol-government.com and newsyandex.com, used to host C&C for 
these samples: 

c93f8a7a899142db1e92138b76407588

e78d39d1862338e4c711238223618e44, h511b0 
 
This registrant has also registered a great deal of other dodgy domains. Mol-government.com and these other domains 
have been used as C&C by Sogu/Thoper trojans in attacks on apparent Korean and Mongolian targets, as well as by other 
malwares like PcClient. 

o yt.bodologetee.com – domain 

This domain has been used as Command & Control domain for a number of samples. It has also been documented used 
by PlugX malware in campaigns apparently against Mongolian targets (3). The same registration information was used to 
register yahoomesseges.com, which has been used by EvilGrab (7) malware.

o YNK JAPAN Inc – digital certificate 

As previously mentioned, two samples were digitally signed using a certificate belonging to YNK JAPAN Inc.; a subsidiary 
of a Korean game producer. This certificate has been used in several hundred samples spanning various campaigns and 
incidents. One of these was the SK intrusion (8) in 2011, where one of the initial malwares - a Sogu/Thoper trojan - was 
signed with it.

Conclusion 

The Maudi malware family seems to have been mostly used against Chinese/South-East Asian targets. However, it shares 
some indicators (C&C domains, registration information) with other, more high-profile attacks.  

What these connections mean is unclear. It might be just sharing of information between groups; we know that there is 
quite a bit of sharing going on, particularly of malware and source code. Less is known about how much is shared in terms 
of infrastructure (ex. domains). 

It is our opinion, however, that the Maudi system hints at something else. There is for example a large amount of 
samples that use the same self-signed certificates in addition to overlaps in other indicators. Self-signed certificates have 
little value in the underground as they can be freely made; so there is little reason for sharing these. Instead the 
impression is that these malwares have been signed by the same malware creation system. 

Another aspect is the architecture where default PoisonIvy shellcode blobs are overridden with configuration information 
from the dropper. This also may indicate homegrown build tools, possibly to alleviate language issues with the PoisonIvy 
builder itself. 

There is a possibility that this indicates a large group of attackers, but might also be a part of a Digital Quartermaster 
function, as recently postulated by FireEye (9).
