Overview
W32.Flamer is a sophisticated cyber espionage tool that targeted 
the Middle East. It is modular in design and contains some novel 
functionality, most notably its ability to spread across networks using 
a previously unknown man-in-the-middle attack against Windows 
Update. Symantec has performed a detailed forensic analysis of two 
of the command-and-control (C&C) servers used in the W32.Flamer 
attacks from earlier this year.

Based on our analysis, we were able to uncover details such as when 
the servers were operational, what entities were targeted, nicknames 
of those involved in the attack, and techniques used by the attackers 
to avoid discovery should the command-and-control server be 
compromised.

Analysis of these C&C servers was performed as a joint effort between 
Symantec, CERT-Bund/BSI, IMPACT, and Kaspersky. This paper 
focuses on the detailed forensic examination Symantec carried out on 
the C&C server images.

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

Background

The first server was set up on May 18, 2012, and, just five hours after it was set up, it recorded the first 
interaction with a Flamer-compromised client. The server would go on to control at least a few hundred 
compromised clients over the next few weeks. The second server was set up on March 25, 2012, and controlled 
over a thousand clients in a period of just over one week.

The servers had been set up to record a minimal amount of information in case of discovery. The systems were 
configured to disable any unnecessary logging events and entries in the database were deleted at regular 
intervals. Existing log files were securely deleted from the servers on a regular basis. These steps were taken in 
order to hamper any investigation should the server fall into the hands of investigators or law enforcement. 

Figure 1

Data security compartmentalization used by W32.Flamer attackers

However, the attackers were not thorough enough, as files revealing the entire history of the servers’ setup were 
available and a limited 
set of encrypted records 
in the database revealed 
that compromised clients 
had been connecting 
from the Middle East. We 
were also able to recover 
the nicknames of four 
authors—D***, H*****, 
O******, and R***—who 
had worked on the code 
at various stages and on 
differing aspects of the 
project.

On both servers command-
and-control activity 
happens through a 
Web application called 
Newsforyou. It processes 
the W32.Flamer client 
interactions and provides 
a simple control panel. 
The control panel allows 
the attackers to upload 
packages of code to 
deliver to compromised 
clients, and download 
packages containing 
stolen client data. 
However, in a technique 
not previously seen 
before the uploaded and 
downloaded packages are 
encrypted, so infiltrating 
the command-and-control 
server does not reveal 
the code or the stolen 
client data. The command-

Page 2

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

and-control server simply serves as a proxy for the data and the data is encrypted and decrypted offline by the 
attackers using keys unique to each client. This application also contains functionality to communicate with 
clients compromised by malware other than Flamer. The Web application was designed to be a framework for 
supporting different malware campaigns.

In addition to avoiding the compromise of their operations, preventing both the uploading of rogue code and 
viewing of stolen data, the setup also maintains a clear distinction of roles. The roles include those responsible 
for setting up the server (admins), those responsible for uploading packages and downloading stolen data 
through the control panel (operators), and those holding the private key with the ability to decrypt the stolen 
data (attack coordinators). The operators themselves may actually be completely unaware of the contents in the 
stolen data. This is due to design of the process to use data security compartmentalization techniques, as shown 
in Figure 1. 

Despite these techniques, we were still able to determine that one of the servers delivered a module instructing 
Flamer to commit suicide and wipe itself off computers in late May 2012, an action we also witnessed through 
compromised honeypots. 

Finally, access to the control panel required a password which is stored as a hash. Despite brute force attempts 
at reversing the hash to plain text, we were unable to determine the plain text password.

What follows is a thorough analysis of one of the command-and-control servers, detailing the server setup, the 
Web application developed by at least four separate authors since 2006, the control panel used by the operators, 
and the database that helps drive the application. The report also includes key information about a second 
server, but in-depth details have been omitted to maintain the brevity of this report. The functionality and 
structure of both servers is identical. The differences are mainly in the amount of data and number of clients the 
servers were exposed to.

Server setup
The first sign of activity from the attackers on the first server was May 18, 2012. At 11:26 (UTC) the first 
scheduled job was run and a little over two hours later the server was fully operational. A malicious package was 
uploaded to the server at 13:53. The first recorded interaction with a W32.Flamer compromised client was at 
16:15, when stolen data was uploaded to the server.

In comparison, the second server saw initial activity on March 25, 2012, and was fully operational on the same 
day.

Page 3

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

During the server set up, the attackers installed various applications and tested connections to the MySQL 
database which supported their custom Web application. The end goal was to install a command-and-control 
application called Newsforyou which interacted with compromised W32.Flamer clients.

An important step taken by the attackers was to hide traces of their activity on the server. They did this by 
disabling logging and securely removing existing log files. The attackers, however, did not clear out the history 
of commands issued through the console by the administrator (root) account. This data was visible and was 
retrieved from the /root/.bash_history file, which revealed these activities. The following table lists and 
describes, in brief, a subset of commands that are most relevant to the server set up:

Following these commands, the Apache server was configured to listen on TCP ports 443 and 8080. The firewall 
was also reconfigured to allow connections over SSH and HTTPS. Logging activities were disabled and existing 
log files were securely deleted where necessary. The server is now ready to interact with compromised Flamer 
clients through the Newsforyou application.

The attackers also set up some URL redirections to disguise the true nature of the requests to an inexperienced 
eye. They would appear to look like legitimate requests for regular looking folder names. An example of one of 
the redirect rules is shown below:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl

Communications between C&C server and compromised 
computers

UnloadChecker.php, which is 
executed every two minutes, 
retrieves data uploaded from the 
compromised computer and places 
it in a tar archive. The archive 
could then be downloaded by the 
operators. Eraser.py is a script used 
to wipe certain files and content 
from folders. On one of the servers 
the operators made an error when 
setting up the scheduled task. They 
used the folder name pycleaner 
when creating the task, but this 
folder does not exist. The folder 
containing the script is pycleanscr. 
As a result, the Eraser.py script was 
never automatically executed.

Figure 2 illustrates the simple setup 
now in place for communicating with 
W32.Flamer compromised clients. 

The next sections discuss the files 
and applications of most interest to 
the investigation, along with their 
locations. The analysis begins in the 
home directory of the unique added 
user, a folder that is created once 
the user is added during the initial 
set up. The usernames here were

Stress testing the application

Simulator
This application consists of a set of Python scripts, which are used to stress test the Newsforyou application. 
This application was only present on one of the servers. The application connects to a chosen server and issues 
various queries that conform to the C&C server protocol. The tests performed during the set up were to add an 
entry (stolen data) and to retrieve a news entry (payload).

A point of interest here is the presence of dnslocation.info as part of the HTTP request header the script builds in 
a file named Connection.py. This is a known Flamer C&C server domain, indicating that the code is being shared 
and used to test across various C&C servers. The timestamp on this file supports this idea as it is stamped March 
22, 2012.

When a Python script is executed, a compiled Python file (.pyc) is generated. Examining these files, we confirmed 
this application was executed on May 18 which corroborates our finding about the system configuration date.

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

Cleaning up

pycleanscr
pycleanscr checks how much free disk space is available on the root partition. It deletes the files in /var/www/
htdocs/newsforyou/tmp/ if the amount of the disk space in use is greater than 75 percent.

Delete.php
Deletes entries in the news_entries table of the MySQL database and securely deletes the files referenced by 
that entry on disk that are older than 30 days.

Disabling logging

LogWiper_fixed.txt
This .txt file is renamed to a .sh BASH script and run to disable logging services, to securely delete any prior log 
files created, and to disable logging in two particular applications required by the attackers: Apache and SSH.

Files are securely deleted using Shred, a tool that repeatedly overwrites files to prevent their recovery, even 
forensically.

The next section will discuss the Web application processing the compromised W32.Flamer client requests.

The Web application

Location: /var/www/htdocs/newsforyou/

The Newsforyou application is written in PHP and contains the primary command-and-control functionality split 
into two parts: the main module and the control panel. The control panel is a basic user interface which allows 
packages to be uploaded and installed on chosen W32.Flamer clients. It also allows for the retrieval of stolen 
data that had been uploaded from these clients.

*Symmetric encryption with known key
**Asymmetric encryption with known public key, private key unknown

The application is designed to resemble a simple news/blog application. This approach may serve to disguise 
the true nature of the application from any automation or casual inspection. Although the code was running on 
a Linux server, it is likely some of the command-and-control servers were running Windows, or at least that the 
code was developed and tested on Windows computers.

The following comment was present in one of the PHP files:

-- This function was added by D***, returns a true/false value
depending on if this is a Windows box

Authors
The PHP source code references four authors, identified in the table below, and also attributes to them 
particular functionality within the code:

It is clear that D*** and H***** had the most input into the project, having edited the most files in the 
application. O****** and R*** were tasked with database and cleanup operations and could easily have had little 
or no understanding of the inner workings of the application.

However, D*** and H***** have direct involvement in handling interactions with clients, as they worked on the 
protocols and also worked on the control panel that the operators used. It is likely D*** and O****** knew each 
other, as they both worked on the same files and during a similar time period in December 2006.

Page 8

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

H***** is responsible for the SignupProtocol, while D*** is involved in the OldProtocol (Flamer), both of which 
will be discussed in more detail in the next section. 

Protocols
The main module communicating with the compromised clients is index.php. It deciphers the protocol then 
logs, decodes, and processes requests. Four protocols have been identified, of which three are in use. The Red 
protocol has not been implemented yet.

The existence of three supported protocols, along with one protocol under development, confirms the C&C 
server’s requirement to communicate with multiple evolutions (variants) of W32.Flamer or additional cyber-
espionage malware families currently unknown to the public.

Page 9

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

These protocols are identified in the table below:

The possibility that multiple Trojans, or at least evolutions of W32.Flamer, are at work here is backed up by the 
fact that four different IDs are used internally to identify them:

Here is a snippet of code that identified connecting clients:

It is likely here that CLIENT_TYPE_SP, CLIENT_TYPE_SPE, and CLIENT_TYPE_FL implemented by D*** are evolutions 
of the same threat. However, CLIENT_TYPE_IP which is implemented by H***** appears to come after the in-use 
Flamer protocol, which suggests that either new variants exist that we are unaware of, or there is a separate Trojan 
at work. They also included an unrecognized fallback for clients.

Stolen Data
Compromised clients upload stolen data to the entries directory. Files stored in this directory are encrypted with a 
public key stored in the database. These files cannot be decrypted without the corresponding private key. There was 
a file of 157,548 bytes still left on the server that the operators did not have the opportunity to download.

The stolen data is encrypted with this public key on the server, thus requiring the corresponding unknown private key 
to decrypt:

-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

Based on timestamps seen on the first server in the /newsforyou/bak directory we determined that the operators 
downloaded the stolen data on four separate dates in May.

A total of around 75 MB of stolen data was found in the backups on one of the servers (server #1). Although the 
timing data is limited here, the timestamps of these backups suggest that the operators could be in the EMEA region. 
There was a four-day delay from the initial setup to when the operators began to retrieve stolen data. This is a 
possible indicator that the information about the new server had to take time to filter down to them. 
Figure 3.1

Megabytes of stolen data by date, server #1

In comparison, the other server (server #2) saw a massive 5.7 GB of stolen data:

Figure 3.2

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

Activity
By examining the files in the bak directories, specifically the number of files contained within the backup archives 
created each day, it is possible to obtain an indication of the activity of the C&C server, which can be seen in the 
chart below: 
Figure 4.1

Number of backup archives created each day, server #1

Figure 4.2

Number of backup archives created each day, server #2

On the first server, there is a clear increase in activity around May 20, which then drops off. This is to be expected as 
computers are cleared up.

On the second server the Flamer operation is in full flow and huge volumes of files are being created on the system.

Page 13

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

Payload
The news directory contains a compressed and encrypted file for distribution to the compromised clients connecting 
to the server. This file is encrypted with a known symmetric key retrieved from the database.

This is the browse32.ocx Flamer module, the sole purpose of which is to remove all known traces of the Flamer 
malware from the compromised client.

The payload is encrypted with this symmetric key:

 

R&^T&IOHIO%^&^E%@#$UIO*()

The control panel

Access to the Flamer control panel requires authentication:

Figure 5

Control panel login page

The following credentials are used to gain access to the control panel (only the MD5 password hash is available; 
attempts to crack the password were unsuccessful):

Username: username
Password Hash: 27934e96d90d06818674b98bec7230fa

The control panel for interacting with Flamer-compromised computers is very basic. The simple interface allows the 
operators to upload packages and download encrypted data stolen from the compromised clients. The operator is 
required to upload specially crafted tar.gz files. The archived filename needs to follow a specific format, which is 
parsed and then stored in the ads or news directory, depending on the file extension used.

The filename format for these packages is as follows:

[USER _ TYPE] _ [USER _ ID] _ [PRIORITY] _ [TEMP _ FLAG][OPTIONAL _ AND _ IGNORED].news
[USER _ TYPE] _ [USER _ ID] _ [EXPIRY _ TIME] _ [AD _ NAME].ad

Page 14

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

The following is a screen shot of the control panel that allows the operator to upload data to the server:
Figure 6

Control panel data upload screen

This approach to uploading packages and downloading data fits the profile of military and intelligence operations. 
A typical control panel is easy to use and self-explanatory. The operator has full control over what to do with the 
compromised clients and has the ability to retrieve and inspect the stolen information. The Flamer control panel 
provides limited capabilities to the operator, preventing them from viewing and interpreting the information being 
exchanged.

This approach would help prevent operators from knowing what is contained within the packages or the significance 
of the data being exchanged between clients and the attackers. Such a design would also serve as a defensive 
measure as it would prevent arbitrary packages from being uploaded and prevent downloaded data being from being 
inspected by unknown parties that may have gained access to the control panel.

The following screen on the control panel allows the user to view and download backed up data from the server:

The tar.gz contains all the relevant stolen data and details of where the information was stolen from. The private key 
is required here to inspect the encrypted data.

The database

Location: /var/lib/mysql

The database is used to store the relevant data about connecting clients, packages to send to the clients, some

The session_log table contains details of all connections to the server while client_log only contains connections 
with a recognized protocol (e.g. valid compromised computers).

Examining the data in the table indicates that 1071 valid requests were recorded from compromised clients. A 
decrypted client log entry contains the following information:

CLIENT _ ID:[UUID]
CLIENT _ TYPE:3 
CLIENT _ VERSION:0
REQUEST _ TYPE:0
RAW _ REQUEST:UNIQUE _ NUMBER=[UUID]&PASSWORD=LifeStyle2&ACTION=1&FILE _
NAME=&FILE _ SIZE=0

The additional sessions logged are likely attributed to researchers who had discovered the whereabouts of the 
command-and-control servers.

The session_log data contained three separate HTTP_HOST values, indicating multiple Flamer C&C server URLs were 
used to access this server.

Although only one encrypted file existed in the newsforyou/entries folder (the stolen data uploaded from the 
compromised clients), the database reveals that 189 records had been created. The other 188 files had already been 
removed from the server. The entry left on the server had been successfully stolen from the computer located in 
Israel.

A final point to note here is in relation to the entry in the news_entries table. Only one record ever existed: the 
malicious payload to clean the computers up, uploaded on May 18, 2012, at 13.43:45. This server only served up one 
package and it was uploaded as soon as the server had been initially configured. The last time a compromised client 
connected to the server was Friday, June 1, 2012, at 11:42:47, and the last log recorded in the database was Friday, 
June 1, 2012, at 11:46:01.

Conclusion

Examining the W32.Flamer servers has provided additional insight into the architecture of not only the threat, but 
also into the command structure of the entities behind it. The server code was written and updated by at least four 
separate individuals, indicating a continuing development effort to support W32.Flamer and, potentially, new or 
additional threats of a similar nature. The command-and-control Web application has been in active development for 
many years, possibly as early as 2006, which is well before Flamer’s earliest seen compilation date in 2010.

The operators of the C&C servers may be a group of less senior individuals, working on a need-to-know basis, as the 
operator is not required (nor has the permission) to interpret the value or purpose of the incoming data. Only the 
attackers have the permission to access and interpret this data. This separation of operational and attacker visibility 
and roles indicates that this is the work of a highly organized and sophisticated group. The likelihood of a large and 
well-funded entity’s involvement in Flamer is corroborated by the use of the unique certificate weakness used to 
hijack the Windows Update feature to spread across networks.

They were also careful to unload and archive data where necessary, remove duplicate files, and delete unnecessary 
files to prevent the server from running out of disk space. This was an ongoing development up to 2011. R***’s edits 
in the source code suggest the concern was less about updating protocols and more about ensuring there was ample 
room on the servers for the stolen data to be uploaded to, begging the question of how much data was actually being 
stolen.

This investigation simply provides a snapshot in time of the Flamer attack campaign. Considering that logging was 
disabled and data was wiped clean in such a thorough manner, the remaining clues make it virtually impossible to 
determine the entity behind the campaign. There is little doubt that the larger project involving cyber-espionage 
tools, such as Flamer, will continue to evolve and retrieve information from the designated targets.
