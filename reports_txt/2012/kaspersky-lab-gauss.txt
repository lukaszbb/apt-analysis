Introduction

While analyzing the Flame malware that we detected in May 2012,  Kaspersky Lab experts identified some distinguishing 
features of Flame’s modules. Based on those features, we discovered that in 2009, the first variant of the Stuxnet worm 
included a module that was created based on the Flame platform. This indicates that there was some form of collaboration 
between the groups that developed the Flame and Tilded (Stuxnet/Duqu) platforms.

Based on the results of a detailed analysis of Flame, we continued to actively search for new, unknown components. A more 
in-depth analysis conducted in June 2012 resulted in the discovery of a new, previously unknown malware platform that 
uses a modular structure resembling that of Flame, a similar code base and system for communicating to C&C servers, as 
well as numerous other similarities to Flame.

In our opinion, all of this clearly indicates that the new platform which we discovered and which we called “Gauss,”  is 
another example of a cyber-espionage toolkit based on the Flame platform.

Gauss is a project developed in 2011-2012 along the same lines as the Flame project. The malware has been actively 
distributed in the Middle East for at least the past 10 months. The largest number of Gauss infections has been recorded in 
Lebanon, in contrast to Flame, which spread primarily in Iran.

Functionally, Gauss is designed to collect as much information about infected systems as possible, as well as to steal 
credentials for various banking systems and social network, email and IM accounts. The Gauss code includes commands to 
intercept data required to work with several Lebanese banks – for instance, Bank of Beirut, Byblos Bank, and Fransabank.

Curiously, several Gauss modules are named after famous mathematicians. The platform includes modules that go by the 
names “Gauss”, “Lagrange”, “Godel”, “Tailor”, “Kurt” (in an apparent reference to Godel). The Gauss module is responsible 
for collecting the most critical information, which is why we decided to name the entire toolkit after it.

Gauss is a much more widespread threat than Flame. However, we have found no self-replication functionality in the 
modules that we have seen to date, which leaves open the question of its original attack vector.

Executive Summary

The first known Gauss infections date back to September-October 2011. During that period, the Gauss authors modified 
different modules multiple times. They also changed command server addresses. In the middle of July 2012, when we had 
already discovered Gauss and were studying it, the command servers went offline.

Gauss is designed to collect information and send the data collected to its command-and-control servers. Information is 
collected using various modules, each of which has its own unique functionality:

 ► Injecting its own modules into different browsers in order to intercept user sessions and steal passwords,  
 

cookies and browser history.

 

 ► Collecting information about the computer’s network connections.

 ► Collecting information about processes and folders.

 ► Collecting information about BIOS, CMOS RAM.

 ► Collecting information about local, network and removable drives.

 ► Infecting USB drives with a spy module in order to steal information from other computers.

 ► Installing the custom Palida Narrow font (purpose unknown).

 ► Ensuring the entire toolkit’s loading and operation.

 ► Interacting with the command and control server, sending the information collected to it,  
downloading additional modules.

 

 

The spy module that works on USB drives uses an .LNK exploit for the CVE-2010-2568  (http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/
vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-2568) vulnerability. The exploit is similar to the one used in the Stuxnet worm, but it is 
more effective. The module masks the Trojan’s files on the USB drive without using a driver. It does not infect the system: 
information is extracted from it using a spy module (32- or 64-bit) and saved on the USB drive.

Infection stats

We began our investigation into Gauss in early June 2012. Based on data obtained through the Kaspersky Security Network, 
we noticed right away that the Trojan appeared to be widely distributed in three particular countries in the Middle East.

Further observation later confirmed this three-country concentration. As of 31 July 2012, we’ve counted around 2500 
unique PCs on which files from the Gauss collection have been found.

Most infected countries

The highest number of infections is recorded in Lebanon, with more than 1600 computers affected. The Gauss code 
(winshell.ocx) contains direct commands to intercept data required to work with Lebanese banks – including the Bank of 
Beirut, Byblos Bank and Fransabank. 

In Israel and the Palestinian Territory, 750 incidents have been recorded.

As can be seen in the above table, with the exceptions of the USA and Germany, all incidents took place in the Middle East. 
However, we believe that in the majority of cases linked to the USA and Germany the affected users were actually in the 
Middle East too - using VPNs (or the Tor anonymity network).

In all, we’ve recorded incidents in 25 countries around the world; however, in all the countries outside the top 10 only one or 
two incidents have been recorded:

Total infected users

Regarding the spreading mechanism used by Gauss, the obtained data leave us with more questions unanswered than 
solved. The overall number of infections (around 2500) that we’ve detected could in reality just be a small portion of tens of 
thousands of infections, since our statistics only cover users of Kaspersky Lab products.

6

When we compare the number of Gauss infections with those of other programs discovered earlier that have either common 
components or structures, we get the following figures:

Stuxnet
Gauss
Flame
Duqu

~50-60

Gauss has been spreading in the region for at least 10 months, in the course of which it has infected thousands of systems. 
On  one hand, this is an uncharacteristically high number for targeted attacks similar to Duqu (it’s possible that such a high 
number of incidents is due to the presence of a worm in one of the Gauss modules that we still don’t know about). However, 
the infections have been predominantly within the boundaries of a rather small geographical region. If the malware had the 
ability to spread indiscriminately – for example, on USB sticks as was the case with Stuxnet – infections would have been 
detected in much greater numbers in other countries.

Operating System Statistics

Gauss was designed for 32-bit versions of the Windows operating system. Some of the modules do not work under Windows 
7 SP1.

Architecture

Gauss is a modular system. The number and combination of modules may change from one infected system to another. In 
the course of our research, we discovered the following modules:

Main loader and communication module

The configuration of a specific combination of modules for each system is described in a special registry key. This technique, 
as well as the configuration structure itself, is similar to that used in Stuxnet/Duqu (storing of the configuration in the 
Windows registry) and Flame (configuration structure). Flame stores its configuration in the main module (mssecmgr.ocx).

We created a special detection routine which helped us to discover various Gauss configurations based on registry 
settings on infected machines. We detected about 1700 such configurations in total, which revealed a picture of modules 
propagation:

As mentioned above, we have been unable to discover the original infection vector and the dropper file that installs Gauss in 
the system. In all the systems we have studied, we dealt with a set of modules that was already installed. It is possible that 
during initial infection, only the ShellHW component is installed, which then installs the other modules.

ShellHW (file name “wmiqry32.dll”/”wmihlp32.dll”) is the main component of the malware which ensures that all other 
Gauss modules are loaded when the malware starts and operate correctly.

Comparison with Flame

As we mentioned above, there are significant similarities in code and architecture between Gauss and Flame. In fact, it is 
largely due to these similarities that Gauss was discovered. We created the following table for a clearer understanding of 
these facts and proof of ‘kinship’ between the two attack platforms:

In addition to the features listed above, there are considerable similarities in the operation of the Flame and Gauss C&C 
servers. The relevant analysis is provided in the C&C Communication section. 

There are more similarities in the code and data of the modules:

 ► C++ runtime type information (RTTI) structures are encoded to hide the names of the standard library classes. The  
 
same encoded names can be found in both Flame and Gauss modules, i.e. the first RTTI structure contains name  
“AVnxsys_uwip” that most likely belongs to the “AVtype_info” class.
 

rpcns4.ocx Flame module: “Flask”

winshell.ocx Gauss module: “Gauss”

10

 ► Most of Flame and Gauss modules contain  dozens of object initialization functions that construct string objects  
 

from encrypted data. The layout of these functions is almost identical.

mssecmgr.ocx

Flame main module

wmiqry32.dll, wmihlp32.dll

Gauss main module

 ► String decryption routines (“GetDecryptedStrings” used in initialization functions) are very similar, although not   
 

identical, because the layout of the structures holding encrypted strings was changed.

Installation

The module checks if it was loaded by “lsass.exe” process and, if true, proceeds with the installation.

It writes itself in files: %system32%\wbem\wmiqry32.dll, %system32%\wbem\wmihlp32.dll and modifies the 
system registry to be loaded instead of %system32%\wbem\wbemsvc.dll file.

To achieve this, it writes the following registry value:

[HKCR\CLSID\{7C857801-7381-11CF-884D-00AA004B2E24}\InProcServer32]
Default = %system32%\wbem\wmihlp32.dll

Operation 

The module is automatically loaded into processes that use wbemsvc.dll. When loaded in “svchost.exe” that was started 
with “-k netsvc” parameter, it starts its main thread.

The module creates “ShellHWStop”, “Global\ShellHWDetectionEvent” events, mutex “ShellHWDetectionMutex”.

Every module is loaded and its export functions are called as specified in the configuration. Most of the actions are logged in 
an encrypted (with XOR) file “%temp%\~shw.tmp”. 

Sample of decrypted “~shw.tmp” 

After loading additional modules, it tries to acquire the same privileges as “explorer.exe” and then starts its C&C interaction 
loop.

Prior to communicating with the C&C, all the information from the other modules’ log files is copied to the ~shw.tmp file. 
Paths to the log files are taken from the TimeStampForUI configuration file. As a result, at this stage ~shw.tmp becomes a 
universal container file containing all the stolen data.

It checks Internet connection (https) by accessing URLs specified in its resource 161.

It then checks an https connection with www.google.com or www.update.windows.com. If “200 OK” is received in reply, it 
sends a request with the proxy server parameters taken from the prefs.js file of the Mozilla Firefox browser. 

15

When an Internet connection is available, it connects to its C&C servers that are specified in resource 131:

Connection is established using WinInet API and is performed in two stages: 

1.  GET request to the server. The response from the server is expected to contain new modules, commands or  
 

configuration data.

 
 

GET [C&C domain]/userhome.php?sid=[random  string]==&uid=VfHx8fHx8fHx8fHx8f
Hx8fHx8fE=

2.  POST request to the server with the contents of the file “~shw.tmp” that contains all data  
 

collected from the infected computer.

 

 

The response from the server is decrypted using XOR and 0xACDC as the key. Exfiltrated data is compressed with Zlib.

 

 

The C&C connection routine is controlled by a DWORD value that is read from the registry value:

[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Reliability]
ShutdownIntervalSnapshotUI

The initial value of the counter is read from resource 181 and is equal to 56. The counter is decremented every time the 
module fails to connect to its C&C server or to the servers specified in resource 161 and it is reset to the initial value after 
every successful connection to the C&C server. The module exits the C&C connection loop when the value of the counter 
becomes equal to zero.

All functionality is implemented in “RevertCache” export. The module starts its main thread and then returns. The main 
thread waits for the “{12258790-A76B}” event and continuously checks for the presence of anti-malware software.

“ValidateEntry” signals the “{12258790-A76B}” event, allowing for the main thread to work for 3 seconds before terminating 
it.

“USBSTOR” string in their information.

When a drive contains “.thumbs.db” file, its contents are read and checked for the valid magic number 0xEB397F2B. If it 
matches, the module creates %commonprogramfiles%\system\wabdat.dat and writes the data to this file, and then deletes 
“.thumbs.db”. 

Then, it infects the USB drives by creating directories with the names .Backup0[D-M] and .Backup00[D-M]

Listing of .Backup0* directory

In the root directory of the drive it creates files “System32.dat” and “System32.bin”, the payload DLLs, and the “.thumbs.db” 
file. The payloads are stored as resources and encrypted with a simple XOR routine.

Description
32-bit payload
64-bit payload

USB Payload

Both 32-bit and 64-bit DLLs implement the same functionality. When loaded using the LNK vulnerability, they start a main 
thread and return. The main thread copies the payload to %TEMP% directory and loads itself again. When loaded from 
%TEMP%, it creates a mutex “Isvp4003ltrEvent”, patches the “NtQueryDirectoryFile” function in ntdll.dll so that it hides its 
files and then sends the “F5” key event to windows of classes “SysListView32”, “SysTreeView32”, “DirectUIHWND”, causing 
Explorer directory listings to refresh. This hides the files. It also waits for the event “Global\RasSrvReady”.

Then, it retrieves the following data from the system: 

 ► Version of the Windows OS

 ► Workstation info 

 ► Network adapter information

 ► Routing table

 ► Process list

 ► Environment variables and disk information

 ► List of visible network shares

 ► Network proxy information

 ► List of visible MS SQL servers

 ► URL cache

All this information is encoded and appended to the file “.thumbs.db” on the infected storage. This file also contains a TTL 
(time to live) value that is decremented by 1 each time the payload starts from the infected storage. When this counter 
becomes equal to zero, the payload disinfects the media by removing “.Backup0*” directories and “System32.dat” and 
“System32.bin” files, leaving “.thumbs.db” file with collected information. Known value of the TTL value is “30.”

There are several “special” versions of the payload. They contain additional PE sections with names “.exsdat,” “.exrdat,” and 
“.exdat”. These sections are encrypted with RC4. The encryption key is derived from an MD5 hash performed 10000 times 
on a combination of “%PATH%” environment string and name of the directory in %PROGRAMFILES%. 

The RC4 key is not yet known, neither is the contents of these sections. The payload also contains a binary resource 100 
that is also encrypted.

Creates events: “{B336C220-B158}”, “Global\SmSrvReady”

All functionality is implemented in “RevertCache” export. The module starts its main thread and then returns. The main

thread waits for the “{B336C220-B158}” event and continuously checks for the presence of anti-malware software.

“ValidateEntry” signals the “{B336C220-B158}” event, allowing for the disk enumeration routine to start.

Writes log file: %temp%\~mdk.tmp

Reads registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum

Checks for running antimalware products by names and exits if they are present:

The version of the module built on 27.09.2011 also exits if started on Windows 7 SP 1.

By querying disk enum in registry, it also tries to identify whether the storage is USB-connected or not by searching 
“USBSTOR” string in their information.

The log file entries are compressed with Zlib.

DllMain starts a thread only if loaded by “explorer.exe”.

Writes log file: %systemroot%\Temp\ws1bin.dat. Log file starts with magic number 0x0A86FD375, encrypted with 
1-byte XOR 0x46. Log file writer is guarded by mutex “Global\ShellSyncCom”.

Reads registry key : 

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Reliability
ShutdownInterval = binary data

Checks Windows version and, onWindows Vista and Windows 7, it accesses %SystemDrive%\Users. On earlier versions, 
it uses %SystemDrive%\Documents and settings and gets list of directories there.

Export “InitShellEx” : Enumerates all entries in HKEY _ USERS, removes all entries in 
SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla\Firefox for each user, searches for its log ws1bin.dat and removes it.

Export “SetWindowEvent” : set event “Global\DhwSyncEvent”, wait for other thread to exit in 20 seconds, then terminate 
that thread.

Export “ShellNotifyUser” : returns 1

Export “ShellNotifyUserEx” : main export.  Starts its main thread that should be monitored by the event “SetWindowEvent” 
and returns. 

Lists running processes and returns if “evil.exe” is running.  
Additionally logs the presence of the following registry keys : 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\KasperskyLab\AVP6”, “HKLM\SOFTWARE\KasperskyLab\
protected\AVP7

Then it starts a loop searching for running instances of %systemroot%\explorer.exe. If found, it injects 
%systemroot%\system32\winshell.ocx (own body) into that process.

It uses an interesting technique to inject itself into Explorer: it creates a remote thread with the address of “LoadLibraryW” 
API as its start address. The path to its ocx file is passed to the function as “lpParameter”.

Telemetry: It retrieves and logs the following:

 ► Computer name

 ► Windows OS version

 ► List of running processes

 ► List of directories in %PROGRAMFILES%

 ► Version of Internet Explorer browser

 ► Primary domain name

 ► Network adapter information

The module is a Windows DLL file with one exported function called “GlobalDeleteAtomL.”\

The module reads the registry key that is originally created by “ShellHW” module : 

HKLM\ SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Reliability 
ShutdownInterval = binary data

If the value is not present in the registry, it writes a random value into that key.

Then, it creates a new TrueType font file “%SystemRoot%\fonts\pldnrfn.ttf” (62 668 bytes long) from a template and using 
randomized data from the ShutdownInterval key. The creation time of the font file is set to the creation time of the Arial font, 
%SystemRoot%\fonts\ARIAL.TTF. 

Then, a custom font named “Palida Narrow” is registered in the system font storage using the “AddFontResourceW” API 
function. The module also creates a registry value: 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts
Palida Narrow (TrueType)=pldnrfn.ttf

The purpose of the addition of this font is not yet known. It appears to contain valid Western, Baltic and Turkish symbols.

Gauss C&C Information

To upload data stolen from infected machines, Gauss uses a number of command-and-control servers predefined in its 
flexible configuration. 

Here’s a look at the decrypted configuration data:

Figure 1 - Gauss encrypted C&C information data

Figure 2 - Gauss decrypted C&C configuration data

38

In the example above, we can see the C&C domains/hosts together with the name of the script (userhome.php) on the 
server which is used for communication.

Going through the multitude of Gauss samples, we identified several domains used as C&C servers:

 ► *.gowin7.com

 ► *.secuurity.net

 ► *.datajunction.org

 ► *.bestcomputeradvisor.com

 ► *.dotnetadvisor.info

 ► *.guest-access.net

Depending on the variant, * can be ‘a’ or ‘b’ or ‘c’ – and so on.For instance, a fully qualified hostname as in the example 
above is “b.gowin7.com”.

Most samples we have use “*.gowin7.com” and “*.secuurity.net”. The domains “gowin7.com” and “secuurity.net “ have 
been registered by  an “Adolph Dybevek, which is most likely a fake identity:

owner-name: Adolph Dybevek
owner-address: Prinsen gate 6
owner-city: Oslo
admin-address: Prinsen gate 6
ICANN Registrar: UNITED-DOMAINS AG
Created: 2012-03-15
Expires: 2013-03-15

As in the case of Flame these domain registration addresses point to existing businesses.  For example, at Prinsens Gate 6 
in Olso, we find a hotel in Norway:

Similarly, many of Flame C&D domain fake registrations used addresses of hotels.

During the period of monitoring, we observed these two main domains pointing to two different servers in India and 
Portugal. Based on passive DNS research, we identified three other servers, located in the US which appear to have been 
used as C&C.

The hosts “gowin7.com” and “secuurity.net”   pointed to the following IP addresses:

On 29th of June, 2012, the two C&C domains “gowin7.com” and “secuurity.net” were changed from IP 109.71.45.115 to a 
new IP 182.18.166.116.

40

Both servers were shut down around July 13th, 2012. Prior to shut down, we managed to collect important information. Both 
appeared to be running Debian Linux, which is consistent with the Flame C&C servers. They were listening on ports 22, 80 
and 443. The SSL certificates were self-signed, once again, the same as in the case of Flame. Here’s the certificate for the 
server in Portugal:

If we are to believe the information in the certificate, it was generated on 17 Feb 2012.

The server at 182.18.166.116 (India) appears to currently host two other related domains:

 ► bestcomputeradvisor.com 

 ► dotnetadvisor.info

Both have been registered by somebody named Gilles Renaud, probably another fake identity:

Registrant:

41

Gilles Renaud
Neugasse 10
Zurich, Zurich 8005
CH

They were previously hosted in the US, at the IPs: 173.204.235.204 and 173.204.235.196. 

We currently have seen samples which used {e,g,h}.bestcomputeradvisor.com and “c.dotnetadvisor.info” for command-and-
control. It’s quite possible that other samples exist pointing to different hosts.

The additional domains  ”datajunction.org” and “guest-access.net” can be found in some samples and it is also used for 
C&C communications. We currently have samples which use “c.datajunction.org” and “d.datajunction.org” but there are 
probably others using “a.*” and “b.*”.

Both have been registered by somebody named “Peter Kulmann,” probably another fake identity:

Registrant Name:Peter Kulmann 
Registrant Street1:Antala Staska 1301/19 
Registrant Street2: 
Registrant Street3: 
Registrant City:Prague 
Registrant State/Province: 
Registrant Postal Code:14000 
Registrant Country:CZ

The address “Antala Staska 1301/19” appears once again to be fake – pointing to a supermarket/pharmacy in Prague:

Currently (as of August 2012), all the  “*.datajunction.org” hosts point to the C&C server in India. Previously, they pointed to 
the server in Portugal.  Just like the others, they were previously hosted  in US. 

In addition to these, we identified another domain named “dataspotlight.net” which was hosted on the same servers.  The 
registrant is unknown and we couldn’t find any samples using it, however, it is probably related to the others.

DNS Balancing

For some of the C2’s, the controllers used a technique known as DNS balancing or “Round robin DNS” (http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS) – probably to even the load. This is a common technique in the case of massive traffic to a 
website, suggesting that at their peak, the Gauss C2’s were handling quite a lot of data.

Here’s one such example of DNS balancing:

 ;;QUESTION SECTION:
 ;DATAJUNCTION.ORG.          IN     A

 ;;ANSWER SECTION:
 DATAJUNCTION.ORG.     900   IN     A     182.18.166.116
 DATAJUNCTION.ORG.    3600   IN     A     173.204.235.204
 DATAJUNCTION.ORG.     900   IN     A     109.71.45.115

As it can be seen, the domain datajunction.org resolves to three different IPs: 182.18.166.116, 173.204.235.204 and 
109.71.45.115.

Conclusion

Gauss is the most recent development from the pool of cyber-espionage projects that includes Stuxnet, Flame and Duqu. It 
was most likely created in mid-2011 and deployed for the first time in August-September 2011. 

Its geographical distribution is unique; the majority of infections were found in Lebanon, Palestine and Israel. One of the 
modules from Jan 2012 contains the path “c:\documents and settings\flamer\desktop\gauss_white_1”. The “flamer” in the 
path above is the Windows username that compiled the project. Given the focus on Lebanon, the “white” version identifier 
can probably be explained as following: “the name Lebanon comes from the Semitic root LBN, meaning “white”, likely a 
reference to the snow-capped Mount Lebanon.” (Wikipedia)

Code references and encryption subroutines, together with the Command and Control infrastructure make us believe Gauss 
was created by the same “factory” which produced Flame. This indicates it is most likely a nation-state sponsored operation.

Between Gauss’ functions, the “Winshell.ocx” module which gives the name to the malware as “Gauss”, steals credentials 
required to access online banking accounts for several Lebanese banks – including the Bank of Beirut, Byblos Bank and 
Fransabank. This is the first publicly known nation-state sponsored banking Trojan.

Another feature which makes Gauss unique is its encrypted payload, which we haven’t been able to unlock. The payload is 
run by infected USB sticks and is designed to surgically target a certain system (or systems) which have a specific program 
installed. One can only speculate on the purpose of this mysterious payload.

The discovery of Gauss indicates that there are probably many other related cyber-espionage malware in operation. 
The current tensions in the Middle East are just signs of the intensity of these ongoing cyber-war and cyber-espionage 
campaigns.
