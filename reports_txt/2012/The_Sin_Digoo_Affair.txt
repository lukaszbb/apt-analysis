"We cannot enter into informed alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors and the plans of our adver-
saries." - Sun Tzu, The Art of War
Introduction
The story of the Sin Digoo affair begins with a set of Internet domain registrations dating back to 2004. Between 2004 and 2011, a person using
the email address jeno_1980@hotmail.com registered several domains using the names "Tawnya Grilth" and "Eric Charles". Curiously, all of
the "Tawnya Grilth" domains showed the registrant's physical address to be a post office box in the fictional/misspelled town of "Sin Digoo",
California.

Figure 1. Characteristics of domains registered by jeno_1980@hotmail.com.
In 2006 and 2007, jeno_1980@hotmail.com registered a number of domains under the "Tawnya Grilth" alias that have appeared repeatedly on
reports published by various automated malware analysis systems and antivirus websites.  The Dell SecureWorks CTUSM research team ex-
amined malware samples using these domains and concluded that these domains were involved in a larger pattern of malware-based espi-
onage, sometimes referred to as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity.
Espionage malware
There are two primary malware families involved with the Sin Digoo domains. One is known as "Enfal", which is short for "EtenFalcon", a
string found inside early samples. The involvement of actors using this malware for espionage was first detailed in 2010 in a joint report by the
Information Warfare Monitor and the Shadowserver Foundation. The report, titled "Shadows in the Cloud: Investigating Cyber Espionage
2.0," was a continuation of research from an earlier report titled "Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network." A later report
by antivirus firm Trend Micro titled "The LURID Downloader" further details a campaign of espionage by this malware against targets world-
wide.

A second family of malware connecting to the "Tawnya Grilth" domains is less well-known, although a couple of antivirus companies have
used the names "RegSubsDat", "RegSubDat" or "Kirpich" to refer to it. A recent variant was described by the information security firm CyberE-
SI in a 2011 blog post titled "India-United States Naval Cooperation.doc Analysis." Details regarding the earlier variant used in the Sin Digoo
activity was first analyzed in a blog posting by Don C. Weber titled "Malware Characteristics Report - Trojan.RegSubsDat.A" on his Security
Ripcord blog.

Figure 3. Sin Digoo connection to RegSubsDat malware
Although windowsaupdate.com is not a "Tawnya Grilth" domain according to the WHOIS data, the name is almost certainly related to the do-
main windowsaupdate.net, especially given the same subdomain naming pattern (e.g., v4, v12, v14).
Victim discovery
CTU analysts sinkholed a number of the "Tawnya Grilth" domains in 2011 and 2012. Traffic from infected victim computers is now sent to
servers that log connections, gather statistics, and notify victims when possible. The initial findings from the sinkholing activity are:

1.  Between 100 and 200 computers located in Vietnam, Brunei, and Myanmar are infected by RegSubsDat. Analysis of the IP addresses con-
necting to the sinkhole show that many are government ministries. Additionally, more than one regional petroleum company and a
newspaper has been infected.

2.  A handful of victim computers in Europe and the Middle East are infected by RegSubsDat, Enfal, and one other unknown trojan. These
computers  belong  to  government  ministries  in  different  countries,  an  embassy,  a  nuclear  safety  agency,  and  other  business-related
groups. Additionally, there is an embassy located inside mainland China that is infected.

The CTU researchers have notified many of the national computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) in the countries where infections
were detected and are continuing this notification process. The notifications include the necessary information to locate victims within the
country, inform the victims, and mitigate the infections.
Link to RSA breach
In addition to the GhostNet link, connections can also be drawn between the malware used in the Sin Digoo activity and the RSA breach re-
vealed in early 2011. According to the US-CERT EWIN-11-077 bulletin, a number of command-and-control (C2) hostnames used by RegSubs-
Dat shared three different IP addresses at different points in time, with one of the hostnames known to be part of the RSA breach. This C2
hostname was used in a piece of malware known as "Murcy", which was detailed in "Command and Control in the Fifth Domain," a 2012 re-
port by Command Five Pty Ltd.

Figure 4. Connection between the RegSubsDat malware and the Murcy malware.
All three IP addresses belong to the China Beijing Province Network (AS4808). Although the RegSubsDat and Murcy C2s shared these IPs a
few months apart, the fact that three IP different addresses at the same ISP overlapped in a short time frame seems to indicate shared infra-
structure used by both the RSA breach actors and other actors using the RegSubsDat malware. AS4808 is known for many other connections to
malware and is considered by some to be a hotbed of espionage C2s, especially the 123.120.96.0/19, 114.248.80.0/20 and 114.248.96.0/20 sub-
nets. These subnets have been seen in DNS records for hundreds of C2 hostnames for dozens of custom malware families, either known for or

suspected in espionage activity.
The RegSubsDat asia-online.us domain was registered by an unknown actor using the email address king_public@hotmail.com. A 2011 blog
posting by "Cyb3rsleuth" traced this email address to a social media profile created by a person living in Beijing named "Wang Liang Chen."
The same email address was used to register many other RegSubsDat domains as well. The social media profile for king_public@hotmail.com
has since been deleted.
Tracking Tawnya
The same type of open-source intelligence can be used to gather information about  the jeno_1980@hotmail.com actor. One domain registered
by jeno_1980@hotmail.com is "socialup.net". This site describes a "like exchange," which is a service that Internet marketers can use to promote
a story on social media sites like Digg or Reddit.

Figure 5. Screenshot of the socialup.net interface.
This type of service falls under the category of "blackhat SEO," a term for a variety of techniques for manipulating search engines and social
media sites for marketing purposes. These methods are considered "blackhat" because they usually lead to a site or user being banned from
the search engine or social media sites if the manipulation is discovered.
The  socialup.net  website  has  been  repeatedly  promoted  on  blackhat  SEO  message  boards  by  various  personas,  including  one  named
"Tawnya".

Figure 6. Example of "Tawnya" promoting socialup.net.

Once a user signs up with socialup.net, they can earn virtual "coins." The coins can be used to promote the user's websites or social media
posts, either by viewing ads or liking other users' stories and links. A user can also buy coins from the owner of socialup.net using PayPal.

Figure 7. Example of interface to purchase coins.
As part of the PayPal transaction, the potential customer can see the payee email address. In the case of socialup.net, PayPal's website shows
that the payment for the socialup.net coins is sent to an individual with the initials jzd. 

Figure 8. Order summary for coins showing payee information.
One of the other "Tawnya Grilth" domains is "i-tobuy.com". This domain was registered in 2004 using the jeno_1980@hotmail.com email ad-
dress and "Sin Digoo" location, but the nickname "xxgchappy" is also shown in the registrant contact data.

Figure 9. Registrant contact data for i-tobuy.com.

Another domain registered in 2004 using the "Sin Digoo" location was "1stsale.net", registered to a "john twk" with the email address xxgchap-
py@vip.sina.com.

Figure 10. Registrant contact data for 1stsale.net.
There is a profile on a Chinese programmers' forum for an "xxgchappy" user who has posted two different email addresses in different mes-
sages on the site. These addresses are xxgchappy@vip.sina.com and           @sina.com.cn (address redacted). The user's name is listed on the fo-
rum's profile page for "xxgchappy" and contains the initials ZD. 

Figure 11. Profile for xxgchappy.
 

Figure 12. Tracing the connections between socialup.net, i-tobuy.com, and 1stsale.net.
Several clues on the Internet point to xxgchappy, or ZD, having a working knowledge of computer programming. The use of the program-
mers' forum, along with postings to that site, indicates he is interested in code related to hooking Windows API functions, a common tech-
nique used in malware. Additionally, both xxgchappy@vip.sina.com and king_public@hotmail.com were the listed email addresses for users
of the "rootkit.com" site, revealed when that site's database was leaked in 2011.
A "rootkit" is a program used for hiding traces of malware on a system, and rootkit.com was a forum for discussing the latest rootkit technolo-

gies. However, simply having an account on rootkit.com does not imply one is using rootkits offensively — many anti-malware researchers
were also members of the site. There are some interesting clues in the database table for both users.
The nickname "Jeno" appears again in the rookit.com user database entry for the user with the email address xxgchappy@vip.sina.com.

Figure 13. Database entries with the xxgchappy and king_public email addresses.
In the entry for king_public@hotmail.com, we see the nicknames "king-rose" and "Club-tom", but even more interesting is the password hash
"e211f11c0b28434bf7f1c8fb510fa9ae". This password hash appears in only one other entry in the rootkit.com database:
(20446,'king-z','e211f11c0b28434bf7f1c8fb510fa9ae','k,z,y',
'wzy_100@hotmail.com',1,1097652186,'','','','','','',0,'','',1284013010,
'123.120.127.153',0,0,0,1284013010,0,0,0,'','','','','',0,''),
Figure 14. Other appearance of the password hash associated with king_public@hotmail.com.
From this evidence, we can deduce that "king-z" is a second, earlier account of king_public@hotmail.com, created using the wzy_100@hot-
mail.com email address. Even more interesting is the 123.120.127.153 IP address the king-z account used to log in. This IP is located inside one
of  the  AS4808  netblocks  famous  for  espionage  activity.  In  fact,  it  is  remarkably  close  to  123.120.127.159,  an  IP  used  by  Enfal  C2  v2.win-
dowsaupdate.net (one of the "Tawnya Grilth" domains) on September 27, 2010. The last account activity for king-z as shown in the rootkit.com
database is September 9, 2010. This data strongly suggests that king_public@hotmail.com is not just a stolen account used to register a domain,
but that the user is involved in the espionage network in some manner.
The password used by xxgchappy@vip.sina.com does not appear elsewhere in the leaked rootkit.com database; however, another leaked data-
base may provide additional clues surrounding the xxgchappy personality.
The        @sina.com.cn (address redacted) email address associated with the user xxgchappy can be found inside an archive posted to the
"hackchina.com" website.
xxgchappy # 2710 #                 @sina.com.cn 
Figure 15. xxgchappy reference from the hackchina.com website.

The archive contains a denial-of-service attack tool called "lankiller".  Inside the lankiller binary is the following comment:
Designed for lyh by xxgc-happy   2002.3.8
Figure 16. Reference to xxgc-happy in the lankiller tool.
Also  included  in  the  lankiller  archive  is  a  README  file  that  describes  the  use  of  the  tool.  It  asks  the  user  to  email  the  author  at  either
            @sina.com.cn or happy@sohu.com.cn.

There is a profile for "happy" on a Chinese video site showing a possible photo of the user. The photo is of a man who appears to be in his ear-
ly twenties and of Asian descent. 
Conclusion
The Sin Digoo activity is only a limited view into a very large amount of espionage-by-malware that is happening in the world. The Enfal,
RegSubsDat, and Murcy malware families possess dozens of defunct and active C2s, and these three trojans are only a tiny subset of the mal-
ware families the Dell SecureWorks CTU research team knows to be involved in espionage activity. Collaboration between government, espi-
onage malware victims, and the computer security industry must improve to better defend against this undercurrent of activity that threatens
to undermine an already weakened economy in countries around the world.
