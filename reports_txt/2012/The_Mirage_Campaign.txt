Introduction
Since April 2012, the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team has
been tracking a cyber espionage campaign that uses a remote access trojan (RAT) named
Mirage (also known as MirageFox). This ongoing attack has targeted a high-profile oil
company in the Phillipines, a military organization in Taiwan, an energy company in
Canada, and several as yet unidentified entities in Brazil, Israel, Egypt and Nigeria.
Analysis
Distribution vector
Based on the data collected by the CTU research team, the campaign's primary attack
vector  is  spearphishing  email  that  targets  mid-level  to  senior-level  executives.  These
emails contain an attachment that includes a malicious payload that installs a copy of
Mirage.
CTU researchers have identified several files that drop and execute a copy of Mirage
onto a target system. These "droppers" are designed to look and behave like PDF docu-
ments. However, the droppers are stand-alone executable files that open an embedded
PDF file and execute the Mirage trojan. In one example, CTU researchers observed an
executable  file  (MD5  hash  ce1cdc9c95a6808945f54164b2e4d9d2)  that  upon  execution
drops a copy of Mirage and opens an embedded PDF of a news story titled "Yemeni
Women can participate in politics just like men, says President Saleh" that was posted
on the Yemen Observer's website.
Behavior analysis
The CTU research team has identified two main variants of the Mirage trojan. These
variants are based on key evolutionary differences in the execution and encodings used
in communication with the command and control (C2) servers.

When Mirage executes, the original file copies itself to a folder under C:\Documents
and Settings\<USER>\ or C:\Windows\ and then deletes the original file. After the ini-
tial copy, Mirage starts the newly created file and exits the original. The newly started
copy creates registry keys to ensure that the system remains infected after every reboot.
CTU researchers have observed the following filenames created after execution:

svchost.exe
ernel32.dll
thumb.db
csrss.exe
Reader_SL.exe
MSN.exe

Phone-home and C2 operations
The data sent by Mirage shares attributes with the malware family known as JKDDOS,
which was researched by Arbor Networks. In its initial phone-home connection, JKD-
DOS sends a system profile to the C2 server. This profile contains the CPU speed, mem-
ory size, system name and username. Similar information and encoding techniques are
seen in the initial phone-home requests of Mirage infections.
Mirage phones home to its C2 servers using a standard HTTP request. From the activity
CTU  researchers  have  observed  when  executing  Mirage  in  a  malware  sandbox,  this
communication commonly occurs over ports 80, 443 and 8080, and it can implement SSL
for added security.
The earliest variant of Mirage uses an HTTP POST request to transmit the initial phone-
home request. This phone-home request contains detailed system information of the in-
fected system to give the C2 server a rough profile of each system that is infected and
that is calling home.

Figure 1. Phone-home request (variant 1).
The payload is encoded with a simple cipher to mask the data being sent to the C2 serv-
er. The cipher encodes the payload by adding each character's ASCII value by its offset
from the start of the payload.

Table 1. Payload encoding.
The initial payload starts with the word "Mirage", which in its encoded state is "Mjtdkj".
From  there,  Mirage  encodes  and  sends  the  MAC  address,  CPU  information,  system
name and username in the initial request to the C2 server.
If the C2 server successfully receives the request, then it responds with an HTTP re-
sponse code "200 OK". The word "Mirage" appears in its payload, followed by two null
bytes. If there is no response or an invalid response from the C2 server, the infected sys-
tem continues to send its initial phone-home request at regular intervals.

Figure 2. Decoded payload (variant 1).
If the infected system connects successfully to the C2 server, then the infected system
continues  to  send  regular  check-in  updates.  These  updates  are  transmitted  the  same
way as the initial phone-home request; however, only the MAC address of the infected

system is sent in the payload.

Figure 3. Decoded check-in update (variant 1).
The second variant of Mirage uses HTTP GET requests instead of HTTP POST requests
to  transmit  the  phone-home  requests'  payload.  This  evolved  variant's  initial  phone-
home request's payload is contained in a Base64-encoded string in the initial request.
The decoded Base64 payload contains a second level of encoding that has several varia-
tions. The data being transmitted in the encoded string contains the same data as the
previous variant, as well as some additional data. One change is the text at the begin-
ning of the phone-home payload. Instead of the word "Mirage" used in earlier variants,
later variants use the phrase "Neo, welcome to the desert of the real", a quote from the
movie The Matrix.

Figure 4. Sample request (variant 2).
The CTU research team has seen the encoding used in variant 2 in other malware fami-
lies. One such malware family is Lingbo, which uses a similar encoding algorithm but
does not contain some of the major characteristics of Mirage. Samples from both mal-
ware families have included strange embedded quotes. Instead of Mirage's quote from

The Matrix, Lingbo contains the embedded quote "It is the end of the world and I feel
Fine", from the REM song "It's the end of the world."
Custom versions and variants
The CTU research team identified several Mirage variants that had unique attributes not
designed for widespread targeting. These custom variants were designed to operate un-
der  specific  conditions  and  to  evade  common  system  defenses.  CTU  researchers  also
found several samples that contained debugging information, possibly from early ver-
sions.
One of the variants was seen in a subset of samples that had been modified specifically
for the environment targeted by the threat actors. These samples had been configured
with default credentials for the targeted environment's web proxy servers. The follow-
ing proxy usernames and password combinations appear in the samples collected by
the CTU research team:

a1:a1
pagmb:pa
quickheal:quickheal

In the debugging versions, the CTU research team discovered two strings that identified
the source code paths from which the samples were compiled:

D:\....\MF-v1.2\Server\Debug\Server.pdb  (MD5  hash  fa26f410d0133f4152ea78d-
f3978c22)
E:\fox_1.2  20110307\MF-v1.2\Server\Release\MirageFox_Server.pdb  (MD5  hash
1045e26819ff782015202838e2c609f7)

The .pdb file extension is commonly used with Microsoft Visual Studio. Its use in these
debugging versions coincides with the samples for Mirage, which were written using
Microsoft Visual C++. CTU researchers also noted that the original name of the trojan
used in the path is MirageFox, which is likely the name used by the threat actors.
This information leads to two potential conclusions:

1.  The two variants of MF-v1.2, the debug version and the release version, allow the
threat actors to customize variants. CTU researchers have already seen this activity.
2.  The use of different drive letters but similar source code paths may indicate that

the threat actors are keeping a repository of tools on a central file server for shared
use.

Identification of victims
From May to the date of this publication, the CTU research team engaged in a sinkhol-
ing operation. During the operation, several of the domains formerly used as part of the
C2 infrastructure were taken over, and all activity to the domains was logged. The sink-
holed domains were no longer in use and were freely available for registration.
During the operation, CTU researchers were able to identify approximately 80 IP ad-
dresses regularly communicating to the sinkhole. After analyzing and decoding the re-
quests,  CTU  researchers  discovered  that  a  subset  of  the  observed  systems  had  user-
names such as "admin" or "owner", and the originating IP address resolved to either a
residence or an antivirus or security company. Because these requests were most likely
from behavioral testing on the malware sample, the CTU research team filtered these
connections out of the results.
After decoding the inbound requests, the CTU research team identified approximately
100-120 infected systems attempting to phone home. The majority of the inbound re-
quests  came  from  Taiwan  or  the  Philippines,  with  several  isolated  cases  in  Nigeria,
Brazil,  Israel,  Canada  and  Egypt.  Many  of  the  IP  addresses  originate  from  networks
owned by the oil company, energy company, and military organization.
Deeper  analysis  of  the  phone-home  requests  and  correlation  with  social  networking
sites allowed CTU researchers to identify a specific individual infected with Mirage. It
was an executive-level finance manager of the Phillipine-based oil company.

Figure 5. Sources of infected hosts.

Threat actors
The threat actors using Mirage have employed several tactics to attempt to hide their
identities and their primary C2 servers. One of the common tactics is using dynamic do-
main name system (dDNS) domains for the callbacks to the C2 servers. dDNS providers
(e.g., Dyndns.com) allow anyone to register for a free third-level domain (e.g., Checkip.-
dyndns.org) and require only a valid email address, which is kept private.
When investigating the DNS addresses of the C2 servers, CTU researchers identified
several IP addresses of hosting companies based in the United States that are running
HTran. HTran software is used to proxy connections from one system to another. In the
past, it has been used to disguise the true C2 servers used by malware authors. In the
CTU research team's 2011 analysis of HTran, the software's author was identified as a
member of the Chinese hacker group HUC, the Honker Union of China.
Despite efforts to operate anonymously, there were several clues that pointed to the true
identities  of  the  attackers.  During  an  analysis  of  the  phone-home  activity,  CTU  re-
searchers  identified  four  unique  second-level  domains  that  were  not  connected  to  a
dDNS provider. Two of these domains shared a common owner's email address, and
two were previously flagged for suspicious activity.

Table 2. Unique second-level domains.
CTU  researchers  correlated  86%  of  the  IP  addresses  the  dDNS  domains  used  in  the
phone-home request to IP addresses of subdomains belonging to domains owned by
dnsjacks@yahoo.com. Of the remaining 14% that were not directly associated, CTU re-

searchers  correlated  10%  to  IP  ranges  that  resolved  to  subdomains  owned  by
dnsjacks@yahoo.com.

Figure 6. Analysis of IP addresses. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
This link between the IP addresses and the subdomains indicates that dnsjacks@yahoo.-
com owns the dDNS domains. Using historical DNS records, CTU researchers were able
to map each of the dDNS domains to a subdomain of a domain owned by dnsjacks@ya-
hoo.com.

Figure 7. Details of IP range.
In the samples CTU researchers analyzed, the other domains associated with the phone-
home activity are asia-online.us, india-videoer.com and Echosky.biz. The CTU research
team previously flagged these domains in the HTran investigation and later in the Sin
Digoo analysis. The analysis of the Sin Digoo affair indicated that jeno_1980@hotmail.-
com and king@hotmail.com were connected. From the data the CTU research team has
collected, indications point to dnsjacks@yahoo.com being either another alias or an asso-
ciate of the actor referenced in the HTran and Sin Digoo analyses.

Conclusion
Mirage represents only one small piece of malware involved in an ongoing worldwide
campaign. Over the past few years, these campaigns have become extremely successful,
and a great deal of intellectual property and company secrets has been stolen from the
targeted companies.
For companies in the targeted industries, it is important to have a strong perimeter secu-
rity line in place. Using active intrusion detection and prevention systems as well as
DNS monitoring for malicious domains is essential to detecting this activity. Companies
that use the Yara malware identification and classification tool for scanning local sys-
tems can use the rules provided in the appendix to search for potential infections.
Traditionally, the success of botnets created by threat actor groups has been measured
by the quantity of infected systems and the difficulty to defend against in the long term.
These targeted attacks show that a successful campaign requires only a small quantity
of infected systems to accomplish the attackers' objectives and to yield extremely power-

ful results.
