Abstract 

There  are  thousands of  undetected online  threats and  malware  attacks  from  around the world 
every day. Most of these attacks take place in cyberspace, where unsuspecting people fall prey to 
various forms of cybercrime.  Common cyber criminal  activity involves stealing sensitive informa-
tion  such  as credit  card details,  online  login  credentials,  browsing history  and email  addresses.  
However, notable  skilled attacks occur when the target  is in possession of  highly-valuable infor-
mation that could be leveraged as a weapon for warfare.  

Hydraq is a family of threats used in  highly sophisticated, coordinated attacks against large and 
high-proﬁle corporate networks.  It  is referred to  as Operation Aurora,  Google  Hack  Attack  and 
Microsoft Internet Explorer 0-day (CVE-2010-0249). An  in-depth code investigation  and analysis 
will  highlight  Hydraq  features  and  capabilities,  and  as  it  unfolds,  questions  will  unravel  on  to 
whether the discovery of  this threat  is just the beginning of a global  arms race against cyberwar-
fare.

Introduction

“In  mid-December,  we  detected  a  highly  sophisticated  and  targeted  attack  on  our  corporate 
infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google. 

...  we  have  evidence  to  suggest  that  a  primary  goal  of  the  attackers  was  accessing  the  Gmail 
accounts of Chinese human rights activists.” 

This statement was taken from  a Google blog post entitled "A new approach to China"[1], in which 
Google declared its decision to stop censoring its search results in China. 

Internet freedom vs cyber crime is a deep issue that crosses all boundaries; and the same brought 
global debate about internet censorship and human rights [2]. 

This  incident  prompted  authorities  and  world  leaders  to  discuss  and  work  on  matters of  cyber 
crime; taking into consideration that cyber threats may affect national security [3].  

The  report  “Tracking  GhostNet:  Investigating  a  Cyber  Espionage  Network”  [4]  as  published  last 
year, highlights cyberwarfare as a major global concern.  

Evidently, an increasing wealth of online information and resources will attract attackers. For high-
profile threats such as Hydraq, it is important to understand the underlying attack technique and its 
technical details.

This paper seeks to explore and discover the level of skill the attackers employed to successfully 
deploy this highly sophisticated attack.

1. How Hackers Gain Access 

1.1 Reconnaissance

Profiling the target is a basic principle of hacking. This refers to a reconnaissance phase where 
the attacker evaluates and determine ways to launch a successful attack. 

Reconnaissance  with Whois, DNS  and IP/Network could provide preliminary information about 
the  target  organization’s  infrastructure.  In  addition,  a  combination  of  social  engineering  and 
physical (on-site) reconnaissance is also considered as a valuable source of information. 

To learn more  about the target, attackers performs passive and active  scanning to understand 
the target network topology, platforms, ports and services, vulnerabilities and security defenses. 

The profiling also extends to people that have knowledge and access to the target organization 
including employees, contractors, and visitors. Cyber reconnaissance is very useful in this case, 
gathering  detailed  information  through  social  networking  sites    and  tracing  digital  footprints 
through search engine results. Attackers could compromise the “circle of trust” of the target, in-
cluding friends, family members and even internet browsing habits can be analyzed to success-
fully gain access. 

1.2 0Day Hack Attack 

Hydraq  exploits  the  zero-day (0day) vulnerability in  Internet  Explorer,  which  is  referred  to  as 
CVE-2010-0249 [5] and MS10-002 [6]. 

In reconnaissance  stage, Hydraq masterminds have  been able to  devise  a plan for successful 
hacking attack. Evidently, the authors found an opportunity to target Internet Explorer and evade 
security detection through an unknown vulnerability. 

Sophisticated  social  engineering  tricks can  then  be  deployed  to  entice  target  users to  visit  a 
compromised web site. 
  
1.3 MS10-002 (CVE-2010-049) Analysis 

It  is  a  common  characteristic  for  attackers  to  obfuscate  malicious  JavaScript  to  conceal  the 
code’s real intentions and also avoid detection by security scanners [Listing 01].

In general use, obfuscation is designed for code protection regardless of whether the intentions 
are good or bad. 

 

 

 

 

 

Hydraq’s  malicious  JavaScript  contains  code  that  takes  advantage  of  Internet  Explorer  (IE) 
HTML object handling flaw  and is triggered when IE tries to access a deleted or incorrectly initial-
ized HTML object. [Listing 02] 

Once the exploit attack is successful, Hydraq’s binary shellcode will then execute on the target 
system.

1.4 Hydraq Binary Shellcode

As shown in Listing 01, Hydraq binary shellcode is u% encoded. A simple bitwise XOR encryption 
and 0xD8 as the key, will reveal the hidden instruction.

2. How Hackers Maintain Access 

Once the  exploit attack  is successful, the attacker will attempt to install a backdoor to maintain 
access.  In this case,  the  downloaded  executable from  the  internet  is a  dropper component of 
Hydraq (Win32/Hydraq dropper). 

The Win32/Hydraq dropper is responsible for the installation of the DLL component, which con-
tains all the features and functionalities for Hydraq’s remote attacker. (see Appendix A for other 
variants methods of installation)

2.1 Win32/Hydraq (EXE) Dropper: Generating Random Service

2.1.1 Method of Installation

1. Upon execution, Win32/Hydraq dropper generates a random service name in the follow-

ing format:

 Ups<3 random characters> 

2.

It drops the DLL component from its resource to %System%\Rasmon.dll. 

3.

It adds the generated service name to the registry entry below: 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SvcHost\SysIns

4.

It then creates and starts a service with the following characteristics detailed below. This 
enables the DLL component to be executed under the context of the generic host proc-
ess, Svchost.exe. 

ServiceName = "Ups<3 random characters>"
DesiredAccess = SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS
ServiceType = SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
StartType = SERVICE_AUTO_START
ErrorControl = SERVICE_ERROR_NORMAL
BinaryPathName = "%SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k SysIns"

2.1.2 Deleting Traces of Installation  

1. Win32/Hydraq dropper’s job  is to install  the  DLL  component  and  remove  its installation 
traces in the registry to avoid  forensic discovery.  The data added in the registry key be-
low is deleted: 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SvcHost\SysIns

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

9

2. Furthermore, as part of clearing its traces on a compromised system, the dropper compo-
nent creates and executes a batch file in %Windows%\DFS.bat. Its primary goal is to delete 
the Win32/Hydraq dropper file (b.exe).

2.2 Win32/Hydraq (DLL) Backdoor: Method of Installation 

2.2.1 Method of Installation 

Once the ”Ups<3 random characters>” service starts to execute, it will run Win32/Hydraq 
DLL under the generic host process, Svchost.exe. The DLL component will then perform the fol-
lowing actions: 

1.

It checks the service  name it is running on. It performs a case sensitive  comparison on 
the  first three  characters of the service  name  “Ras”.  If it  is not  the  same, it  stops the 
service operation and deletes the current service. It then registers a new  service name in 
the following format: ”RaS”<random 4 characters> 

This behavior suggests that Win32/Hydraq DLL changes its service name every time an infected 
system  is rebooted,  or the  service  is restarted. The  malware will  never  have a  service  name 
starting with ”Ras” due to the fact that it generates a service name starting with  ”RaS” (Take 
note of the case sensitive comparison). 

2. The DLL component creates a service with the following characteristics: 

ErrorControl: SERVICE_ERROR_IGNORE
Start: SERVICE_AUTO_START
Type: SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
ImagePath: %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs 

3. Similar to the Win32/Hydraq dropper, the DLL component takes advantage of the available 
privileges running  under the context of trusted Windows system  processes. It adds the fol-
lowing registry entry as a parameter to the newly created service. 

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RaS<4  random  char-
acters>\Parameters\ServiceDll = %system%\Rasmon.dll 

4. In addition, the DLL component also adds an entry of its service name in the following reg-
istry entry below. 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersions\Svchost\netsvcs

3. Cyber Spy In Control

3.1 Initialization of the Backdoor Configuration

The attackers behind Hydraq  maintain access by installing  the Win32/Hydraq DLL component. 
Once installed, the backdoor will start  to initialize the  configuration  needed  to perform  its func-
tionalities. 

The configuration file is encrypted and stored in the resource section of the DLL file. To decode 
it, Win32/Hydraq DLL employs the following steps: 

1. Decryption using bitwise XOR with 0x99 as the key. 
2. Customized character decoding (see Appendix C). 
3. Decryption using bitwise XOR with 0xAB as the key. 

Take note that some variants of Hydraq do not store the configuration in the resource file. These 
variants reference  the  registry entry HKLM\Software\Sun\1.1.2\AppleTlk for the remote 
connection information. The data found in the key can be decoded using the customized charac-
ter decoding logic as specified (see Appendix C). 

3.1.1 Using an Interactive Service

The  Win32/Hydraq  DLL  backdoor  component  is  installed  and  running  under  the  context  of 
Svchost.exe, which is a system  process. This service is non-interactive and cannot interact with 
the user or access GUI  objects. To enable the interactive service, the backdoor will  perform  the 
following: 

1. Assign the default desktop object to the Win32/Hydraq DLL thread. 
2. Assign the winstat0 window station to the Win32/Hydraq DLL process.

These actions enable access to GUI objects. 

3.2 Command and Control

Win32/Hydraq contains an encoded backdoor configuration in the file’s resource section. Once de-
coded it uses this information to communicate with the Command and Control (C&C) server. 

The  first  information  accessed  in  the  configuration  is  the  C&C  server  hostname,  which  can  be 
found at offset 0x00 until the null delimiter.

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

11

 [Listing 05 - Win32/Hydraq decoded resource]

3.3 Backdoor Configuration: Resource Section and Registry Key

The Win32/Hydraq backdoor configuration determines the parameters to enable the remote at-
tacker recognize and gain control of the affected system. The configuration is stored in the: File 
Resource Section, and/or in a Registry Key.  

3.3.1 File’s Resource Section 

As shown in Listing 05, the Win32/Hydraq backdoor configuration is stored in the resource section 
of the  file.  It  retrieves  the  specified  hostname,  and  attempts  to  establish  a  remote  connection. 
However, to  perform  this task,  the backdoor needs to resolve the  specified hostname. Based on 
the code, the backdoor checks the  hostname IP  address if it  is a valid IPv4  Internet address (for 
example, 111.222.123.111). If it is not, it will retrieve the hostname IP  address using an avail-
able DNS. 

The backdoor connects to 168.95.1.1 using port 53 as an alternate DNS to resolve the server 
address. This stand-by solution is only valid in the next 5 minutes from  the time the backdoor ac-
cesses the alternate DNS server. 

3.3.2 In the Registry Key 

The backdoor also checks the registry key HKLM\Software\Sun\1.1.2\AppleTlk. The value 
contained in this key is encoded information about the remote connection details. 

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

12

If the registry key exist, it will decode the value using the following steps:

•
•

Perform a bitwise XOR with 0x99 as the key on each byte.
Perform the same custom  decoding logic it used in the configuration found in file’s resource 
section.

The  updated  configuration  is always stored  in  the  registry.  The  backdoor  will  then  retrieve  the 
specified hostname and alternate DNS to establish a remote connection.  It checks the hostname 
IP Address if it is a valid IPv4 Internet address. If it is not, it retrieves the hostname IP  address us-
ing an available DNS. If the backdoor cannot resolve the hostname IP  address, it will sleep for two 
minutes and attempt to resolve the IP address using an available DNS again (see Listing 06). 

If the registry key HKLM\Software\Sun\1.1.2\ does not exist, the backdoor continues the con-
nection  using the configuration  specified from  the backdoor resource section. Take  note  that the 
priority configuration  used  is always from  the  registry key next  is the configuration  from  the  re-
source. 

 [Listing 06 - Win32/Hydraq reconnects after 2 minutes]

3.4 Backdoor Communication Protocol 0x00: Establishing Communication 

In the context of discussing the backdoor functionalities, we will refer to the following terms as 
follows: 

Client or remote server - is defined as the remote attacker. 
Server - is defined as the system where the Win32/Hydraq backdoor is installed. 

As soon as the server’s IP  address is resolved, the server attempts to initiate a connection to the 
client and a 3-way handshake process is performed: 

3.4.1 SYNchronize

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

13

The client sends a custom SYNchronize packet containing the following 20 bytes as initial hand-
shake. 

FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FE FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 88 FF

The set of bytes above are encrypted using a bitwise NOT operation. Thus, the raw  set of bytes is 
the following:

00 00 00 00 00 00 FF FF 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 77 00

As  shown  in  Listing  07,  the  Win32/Hydraq  backdoor 
code  includes  a  routine  that  constructs  the  20  byte 
SYNchronization packet that is sent to the client. 

The  initial  handshake  was  captured  during  a  test 
simulation  performed  in  a  controlled  environment  as 
shown in Appendix B. The backdoor uses port 443 
to connect to the server. Port 443 is the known default 
port for the HTTPS protocol. 

However, in this case, the Win32/Hydraq backdoor did 
not take advantage of the  available SSL/TLS encryp-
tion to secure its communication to the client. The in-
formation contained in the packet is evidently showing 
the set of bytes constructed  by the malware. 

3.4.2 SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement 

 [Listing 07 - Constructing Initial Handshake routine ]

The client will  identify the initial  SYN  packet sent by the  server. If valid, the client will respond a 
SYNchronize ACKnowledgement packet 20 bytes in size. The sets of bytes are encrypted using a 
bitwise XOR with 0xCC as the key. 

CC CC CC CC CD CC CC CC CD CC CC CC CC CC CC CC AA AA AA AA

 [Listing 08 - Acknowledgment data decryption routine ]

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

14

The server will validate the SYN-ACK packet from  the client expecting the following decrypted val-
ues: 

00 00 00 00   01 00 00 00   01 00 00 00   00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00

Take note that,

Offset 0x00 must be equal to 0x0000
Offset 0x04 must be equal to 0x0001
Offset 0x08 must be equal to 0x0001
Offset 0x0C must be equal to 0x0000

3.4.3 ACKnowledge

Once  the  server  receives  the  expected  SYN-ACK 
packet, it will respond by sending an ACKnowledgement 
of receipt. The following tasks are performed: 

  a.  Collect  the following  information from  the  compro-
mised system.

•
•
•

•

Computer name 
CPU clock speed 
Memory status – specifically gets the amount of actual physical memory in bytes and con-
verts it to megabytes.

b. Encrypt the information collected using a custom  encryption were the key used is derived from 
the result of GetTickCount API. The encrypted data will be encrypted again using a bitwise NOT.

c. Generate a CRC hash value of the encrypted information. 
d. Send the collected information to the client.

3.5 Backdoor Communication Protocol 0x01: Execution of Client-Server Commands 

During the 3-way handshake process, we discovered that the Win32/Hydraq backdoor constructs a 
custom  packet. This is a communication protocol designed so that the client and server can recog-
nize each  other over the network. The information header format is different from each end point.

3.5.1 Client’s Information Header Format 

 [Figure 1 - The client process the server information header.]

The constructed information header is 20 bytes in size in the following format:  (Note: The values in

3.6 Backdoor Command Reference

Aside from the malware code obfuscated with JMPs and NOPs, Win32/Hydraq also constructs a 
reference table that will be used by the Command Reference field found in the client’s informa-
tion header to convert the actual commands. 

Once the server receives a  packet from  the client, it performs the  following task  to convert the 
client’s Command Reference value:

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

1. Perform  a  bitwise XOR with 0xCC as the  key   in 

the information transmitted. 

2. The  value  in  the  Command  Reference  field  will 

be added with negative two (-2). 

3. Match the  value obtained in  Step  2 in the  Table 

05 to get the Actual Command. 

To elaborate  on this further,  let’s take an example 
where  the  remote  attacker  requests  information 
about the logical drive of the compromised system. 

In Table 05, the Command Reference  for retrieving 
the  logical  drive is Command 0x04. (see Table  06 
for Backdoor Command and Task reference) 

In this example, the Command Reference is CA CC 
CC CC, and the Task Number is CC CC CC CC. 

Converting the correct instruction to execute: 

1.0xCCCCCCCA XOR 0xCCCCCCCC = 6

3.7 Backdoor Command Table

The  Win32/Hydraq  backdoor  features 10  command  switches, which  theoretically allow  the  re-
mote  attacker to  perform  almost  everything. An  attacker  can  manipulate files,  registries,  serv-
ices, process,  privileges, search  files and directories, remote  download, update configurations, 
open  applications,  and  steal  any desired information. Attackers can initiate real-time  graphical 
control and watch  a user’s desktop using  Command 0x07 Task 0x0b (see Appendix D  for 
discussion of acelpvc.dll and VedioDriver.dll installation).

3.9 Backdoor Commands In Action

“Primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activist” 
- statement published in a Google blog post entitled “A new approach to China”.

Malware designed for spying and obtaining sensitive information must have the following offensive 
capabilities: 

1. Probing -  the act of searching, exploring, and investigating.
2. Exfiltration of sensitive information.
3. Surveillance  - the ability to capture images, audio and/or video.
4. Covert Communication Channel - is a hidden communication embedded into the header and/
or payload of an overt communication channel  to  avoid discovery of on-going  attacks over the 
network. 
5. Covering Tracks - the ability to stay undetected and avoid forensic discovery. 

Let’s summarize and see what we have learned and discovered from Hydraq’s code. 

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

24

3.9.1 Probing and exfiltration of sensitive information 

The Windows Registry is the heart of the  Windows Operating System. It  stores users profile, in-
stalled applications,  privileges for applications and  folders,  hardware  profiles, current  logged-on 
information,  mounted  devices,  the MRU  list, wireless    network  information, LAN  computers and 
passwords [10]. 

Using Command 0x03 Task 0x00 and Task 0x01, a remote  attacker using  Hydraq can sub-
stantially extract useful information from Windows Registry. 

Command 0x03
Command 0x03

Task 0x00

Task 0x01

Enumerate sub keys of a registry key and send the information back to 
the client.
Enumerate values of a registry key and send the information back to the client.

Using Command 0x01 Task 0x00, a remote attacker using Hydraq can find out the services that 
are available on the compromised system. Windows services display what type of connections is 
available that attackers can take advantage of to administer further attacks. 

Command 0x01

Task 0x00

Enumerate service conﬁguration and sends back to the client.

Using  Command 0x04 Task  0x00,  a  remote  attacker using  Hydraq  can  determine  all  logical 
drives and if the disk drive is a removable, fixed, CD-ROM, or network drive. (see Backdoor Com-
mand Reference Listing 13 for the captured communication of client-server)

The attacker can then execute Command 0x04 Task 0x07 to search  a directory or Command 
0x06 Task 0x01 to search a file. 

Command 0x04
Command 0x04

Task 0x00

Retrieves information about all logical drives, volume information, disk space 
and drive type. It then sends the gathered information to the client. 

Task 0x07

Searches the directory and sends all ﬁlenames to client. 

Command 0x06

Task 0x01

Creates a thread to perform the following: 

1. Search a  ﬁle with conditions (date time created).
2. Send the ﬁle to remote server 

Through Command 0x03, a  remote  attacker using  Hydraq  can  manipulate  the  registry and  use 
Command 0x05 Task 09 to store and update gathered information. Command 04 Task 09 
retrieves the stored information and assures the integrity of the file sent to remote attacker. 

The backdoor can retrieve any file and information at anytime using Command 0x06 Task 01. 

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

25

Hydraq  reads the  contents of network.ics using Command 0x09 Task 0x01.  Network.ics con-
tains information including network name and number mapping for local area network. 

Command 0x09

Task 0x01

Reads 616 bytes (0x268) of information stored in the ﬁle %system%\drivers
\etc\networks.ics and sends the content to the remote server. 

The attacker can  manipulate  the routing table to  redirect traffic to the compromised  system. The 
Command 0x04 Task 0x02 can  be  used  to  open  or execute  a file  or program,  and Command 
0x04 Task 0x08 can be use to update network.ics content. 

Thus, it can perform  a  man-in-the-middle attack, where attacker can intercept traffic and capture 
information. 

3.9.2 Surveillance

Hydraq probing capabilities can determine whether the compromised machine has audio/video en-
abled applications and  devices (for example instant messengers and webcam  connection). The 
attacker can use available application and devices to capture images, voice and video for surveil-
lance. 

However, as discussed  earlier, Hydraq can also initiate a real-time graphical control and  watch a 
user’s desktop using Command 0x07 Task 0x0B (see Appendix D  for discussion of acelpvc.dll 
and VedioDriver.dll installation). 

3.9.3 Covert Communication

As  discussed,  Hydraq’s  client-server  uses  port  443  as  an  overt  communication  channel1   (see 
Backdoor Communication Protocol) and embeds a custom  header (see Appendix B  showing the 
initial handshake header)  to avoid discovery of on-going attacks over the network.  

3.9.4 Covering Tracks

Covering tracks is important in hacking. It extends or allows the attacker to stay undetected for a 
long period of time. It also removes evidence of hacking and lessens the chances of identification. 

If Hydraq can escalate privileges it can also  adjust them; if it can execute and  run  any program/
application, it can terminate it. It can remove its traces in services, registry, file/s, folder/s, change 
file attributes and move file/s into different locations. It can also force shutdowns or reboot the sys-
tem, which can remove valuable traces in memory to avoid digital forensics discovery. 

Furthermore, in Command 0x04 Task 0x02 the  remote  attacker can  clear Application Event 
logs. 

1 Overt channel is any communication path for the authorized data transmission within a computer system or network. HTTP 
and HTTP SSL is an overt channel.

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

26

Command 0x05

Task 0x05

Clears the “Application” event logs. 

3.9.5 Expandable Features

In  Command 0x02 Task 0x00,  the  remote  attacker  can  download  and execute  arbitrary files 
onto  compromised  systems,  and  it  can  adjust  process  token  privileges  using  Command 0x00 
Task 0x00. This sets of commands further expands the capability of the attacks. 

Command 0x02 Task 0x00

Execute a new thread to perform the following: 

1. Connect to the client.
2. Downloads an arbitrary ﬁle. 
3. Save it as %Temp%\mdm.exe
4. Execute the downloaded ﬁle, else delete the ﬁle. 

Command 0x00

Task 0x00

Adjust Token Privilege / Access Privilege Escalation and Enumerate Process.

The backdoor configuration that is stored in the registry can be updated using Command 05 Task 
0x08. This means that the remote attacker can modify and change the connection details at any-
time.

Summary

The discovery of Hydraq allowed us to explore and understand the underlying features of a highly  
sophisticated means of attack. It takes time, organization, skill, and resources to successfully de-
ploy coordinated attacks against high profile infrastructures such as Google. 

Clearly, the increasing wealth of information stored in the cloud2 is becoming an attractive target. 
The emerging world of cyberspace is now  at war against cybercriminals and those conducting cy-
berwarfare [7] [8]. Sophisticated attacks exploiting unknown software vulnerabilities as means of en-
try point provides an advantage for attackers to silently infiltrate and perform various forms of spy-
ing including the ability to  deploy video  and  audio  surveillance, and the probing  and  stealing of 
sensitive  desired  information. 
  Hydraq’s  communication  protocol  is  carefully  crafted  and  re-
searched making it difficult to detect and recognize an on-going attack over the network. The level 
of detail of the backdoor commands allow  a remote attacker to perform the necessary tasks using 
a smaller resource footprint. 

In conclusion, the emergence of this type of sophisticated offensive capability will continue to pose 
challenges for cyberspace security defenses. By exposing the intricate details of Hydraq, we hope 
to assist and contribute to overall cyber security learning and awareness. 

2 Cloud refers to services accessed and stored on the internet cloud. Take note, Google disclosed  that attackers accessed 
two Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activist. [1]

Safe Computing Habits

With the proliferation of Web-based attacks vector and the increase in global  Internet usage, it is 
more important than ever to be cautious to ensure safety online. Security is a process. To be se-
cure, you must be aware, apply the right technology, understand your daily computing activity and 
identify the amount of information or data you want to secure. 

Let the Technology Work For You

Here are some easy steps and reminder to ensure that your CA security products provides optimal 
protection for you.

1. Your security scanner must be always turned on and up-to-date with the latest signature. Real-
time scanning  protects you  from  possible  infection that you may get  from  compromised  Web-
sites, network shares, email and flash drives.

2. Turn  on  your firewall.  Your  firewall  provides a  different  layer of security that  guards you  from 
network attacks and blocks unauthorized access to your machine. A firewall with real-time mal-
ware behavior intrusion detection could prevent or lessen the impact of malware infection. 

3. Turn on Data Execution Prevention (DEP). This feature is available in Windows XP SP3, Win-
dows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista and Windows 7. Refer Microsoft in-
struction on how to configure memory protection in Windows XP SP 2 at 
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc700810.aspx 

4. Increase  your  browser  security  settings.  You  can  refer  CERT  Web  browser  security  tips  at 

http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser

Be Security-Aware

1. Do NOT open email from people you don’t know. Think twice and verify before clicking a URL or 

open an attachment. Don’t be click happy! All it takes is a moment of inattention. 

2. Implement  strong  password.  Refer  to  these  Microsoft  Tips  for  creating  a  strong  password: 

http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/password/create.mspx

3. When conducting online banking or financial transaction, make sure your browser connection is 

secure.

4. Encrypt online communication and confidential data.

5. Back up your important data. Keep a copy of all your files and store them separately. 

6. Be  cautious about instant messaging. Avoid  chatting  with  people you don’t  know, especially if 

they ask for personal information such as photos or want you to do something for them. 

7. Protect your identity while enjoying online social networking activities. Be wary of clicking links or 
suspicious profiles. Double-check the integrity of the connection or friend request before adding 
anyone to your network. Avoid installing extras such as third-party applications; they may lead to 
malware infection, or attackers could use them to steal your identity. 

8. Avoid piracy by downloading from secure sources.

CA ISBU-ISI WHITE PAPER: IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYDRAQ

29

9. Avoid  threats that use social  engineering  techniques by checking user feedback  about  a Web 

site before visiting it, and reader feedback about an application before installing it. 

10. If you are using Adobe PDF Reader, prevent your default browser from automatically opening 

PDF document. Refer to our CA Security Advisor research blog entry at

 (It searches for services with this value as a command line parameter)
b. If the ImagePath value is found, it checks the registry key below and retrieves the 

value of ServiceDll registry entry:  

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service name>\Parameters

c. The malware modifies the service's configuration, modifying the service Start and Type 
characteristics to the following: 
           Start - 2 SERVICE_AUTO_START
     Type - 110         
 
 

SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS|SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These service modifications enable the service to start automatically, interact with the desk-
top, and run in its own process. 

3. If Step 2 is successful, the malware performs the following instructions: 

a. Loads the resource file in memory and writes the resource's content to a file in "%USER-
PROFILE%\<service name>.dll".
This behavior drops the DLL component in the directory, 
"%USERPROFILE%\<service name>.dll"

Note: %USERPROFILE% is "C:\Documents and Settings\<username>".

b. As part of its anti-forensic discovery, the malware modifies the DLL file time attributes to 
be the same as kernel32.dll.

The date created, last accessed, and last modified will be modified in this case. 

c. The Hydraq dropper modifies the registry key of the target service:
                                                                                
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service name>\Parameters\ServiceDll = 
"%USERPROFILE%\<service name>.dll"

 This automatically executes the DLL component on system start.

d.The malware starts the target service to execute the DLL component.

4. If Step 2 is NOT successful, the malware performs the following instructions: 

a. Loads the malware's resource file in memory and writes the resource's content to a file in 
"%USERPROFILE%\<random name>.dll".
This behavior drops the DLL component file in the directory "%USERPROFILE%\<random 
name>.dll"

Note: 
%USERPROFILE% is "C:\Documents and Settings\<username>".
<random characters> is based on the result of GetTickCount API.

b. The malware creates a service with the same name as the generated filename of the 

DLL component and with the following characteristics:

DesiredAccess = SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS
ServiceType = SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS|SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS
StartType = SERVICE_AUTO_START
ErrorControl = SERVICE_ERROR_NORMAL
BinaryPathName = "%SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k "random name""
                                                                                                
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\Type = 
SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS|SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\Start = SERVICE_AUTO_START
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\ErrorControl = dword:00000001
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\ImagePath = 
%SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k "<random name>"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\DisplayName = "<random name>"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\ObjectName = "LocalSystem"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\Description = "<random name>"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\Parameters\ServiceDll = "%US-
ERPROFILE%\<random name>.dll"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random name>\Parameters\StubPath = <drop-
per component filename>
           
It also adds the service name in the registry key below so the service will be executed on 
start as a system service.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SvcHost\<random name> = <random 
name>

c. The malware starts the created service to execute the DLL component.

If the malware fails to create the service it adds the following registry entry:
                                                                
HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\<random name> = rundll32.exe 
"%USERPROFILE%\<random name>.dll", Launch

It then executes the process with the parameters below. If this fails the malware will delete 
the DLL component file.
rundll32.exe "%USERPROFILE%\<random name>.dll", Launch

Lastly the malware executes the file cmd.exe with the command line parameters below. 
The purpose of this is to delete the dropper component.
 "%system%\cmd.exe /c del "<dropper filename>" > nul"

Appendix B - Initial Handshake

Appendix C - Customize Character Decoding

Resource decryption - Resource size is 0x158. 

The malware does not modify the first 8 bytes of the resource and decodes the remaining 
0x150 bytes using bitwise XOR on the 0x150 byte of the resource with 0x99 as the key. The 
following decoding logic is used:

Appendix D - Real-time Graphical Control 

The Hydraq backdoor client can initiate real-time graphical control through the installation of Vir-
tual  Network Computing (VNC). Based on the malware code, the VNC  DLL component can be 
installed in this sequence: 

1. Client sends Command 0x04 Task 0x08 to upload the file acelpvc.dll.
 
2. Client initiates Command 0x07 Task 0x0B. 

a. Get the file attributes of the file %System%\acelpvc.dll, 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

check if it is directory or file, 
exit if its a directory. 

 
 

 
 

b. Get address of acelpvc.dll’s export function “EntryMain” 
c. Get the file attribute of the file %System%\VedioDriver.dll, 

 
 

 
 

 
 

check if it is directory or file, 
exit if its a directory. 

3.1 If %System%\VedioDriver.dll exists, 

a. Load acelpvc.dll in the memory space of the malware. 
b. Execute acelpvc.dll’s EntryMain export function with the server IP  address and port 
as the  parameter. The  client  is expected to  have a  VNC  client to  receive  the frame-
buffer [9] from the server. 

3.2 If %System%\VedioDriver.dll does NOT exist, 
a. Contact the client to download VedioDriver.dll 
b. The Server receives VedioDriver.dll from the client. 
c. Verify the CRC value of the created file from the server, and delete if it is different. 
d. Modify  the  file’s  date  and  time  attributes  to  be  the  same  as  the  system  file, 

user32.dll.
