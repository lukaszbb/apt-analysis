OPERATION 

  AURORA

 February 10, 2010 

Cyber  Espionage  is  a  critical  issue.  Over  80%  of  intellectual  property  is  stored  online  digitally.  The  computing 
infrastructure in a typical Enterprise is more vulnerable to attack than ever before. Current security solutions are 
proving ineffective at stopping cyber espionage. Malware is the single greatest problem in computer security today. 
Yet, malware represents only the tip of the spear. The true threat is the human being who is operating the malware. 
This  human  and  the  organization  represented  is  the  true  threat  that  is  targeting  information  for  the  purposes  of 
ﬁ nancial gain, theft of state secrets, and theft of intellectual property. True threat intelligence requires reaching beyond 
malware infections to identify the individuals, country of origin, and intent of the attacker.

2  HB GARY THREAT REPORT: OPERATION AURORA

THREAT SUMMARY
The Aurora malware operation was identifi ed recently and made public by Google and McAfee. This malware operation has been 
associated with intellectual property theft including source code and technical diagrams (CAD, oil exploration bid-data, etc). 
Companies hit have been publically speculated, including Google, Adobe, Yahoo, Symantec, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, 
Northrop Grumman, and Dow Chemical. The malware package used with Aurora is mature and been in development since at 
least 2006. 
The Aurora operation is characterized by a remotely operated backdoor program that persists on a Windows computer. This 
backdoor program has several capabilities that are outlined below.

KEY FINDINGS

Evidence collected around the malware operation suggest 
that Operation Aurora is simply an example of highly effective 
malware penetration. There is not signifi cant evidence to 
attribute the operation directly to the Chinese Government. 
However, key actors have been identifi ed in association 
with malware operations that utilize Chinese systems and 
native language malware.  This has lead to a great deal of 
speculation about Chinese-State involvement.  It must be 
noted that a large and thriving underground economy exists 
to both build and disseminate malware worldwide, and that 
most of this malware is capable of intellectual property 
theft.  The malicious hacking underculture is strong in China, 
as in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, and clearly enmeshed 
into a global criminal economy of data theft.  While diffi cult 
to conclude that these activities receive any form of state 
sponsorship or direction, the malware operation remains a 
funded and signifi cant risk to intellectual property in the 
enterprise.

ASPECT

DESCRIPTION

Target

Origin

Developers

The operation is targeting intellectual property with 
no specifi c industry focus. This is an example of “not 
knowing what they are looking for until they fi nd it”.

It is highly probable that the malware was developed 
in native Chinese language, and the operation control 
system is designed for Chinese users, indicating the 
entire operation is Chinese. This does not, however, 
mean the Chinese Government is using the system.

Forensic tool-marks in the CRC algorithm can be 
traced to Chinese origin. That, combined with domain 
registration information, leads to at least one potential 
actor, Peng Yongii. The malware has been in development 
since at least 2006. It has been updated several times.

ASPECT

DESCRIPTION

Operators

Intent

Coms

Operators of the malware appear to use certain domains 
for C&C control. Dynamic DNS is a key feature of the 
operation, with many known C&C servers operating 
from domains registered through Peng Yong’s 3322.org 
service.

The primary intent is the theft of intellectual property. 

Communication is encrypted over HTTP, port 443, 
obfuscated with a weak encryption scheme. The C&C 
servers tend to operate from domains hosted on 
dynamic DNS.

ATTRIBUTION

At this time, there is very little available in terms of 

attribution. A CRC algorithm tends to indicate the malware 
package is of Chinese origin, and many attacks are sourced 
out of a service called 3322.org — a small company operating 
out of Changzhou. The owner is Peng Yong, a Mandarin speaker 
who may have some programming background with such 
algorithms. His dynamic DNS service hosts over 1 million 
domain names. Over the last year, HBGary has analyzed 
thousands of distinct malware samples that communicate with 
3322.org. While Peng Yong is clearly tolerant of cyber crime 
operating through his domain services, this does not indicate 
he has any direct involvement with Aurora.

JAVASCRIPT AND SHELLCODE

The JavaScript based attack vector associated with 

Operation Aurora was published in the public domain in early 
January 2010. Microsoft details the vulnerability in Security 
Bulletin MS10-002. Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 
6, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and 
Internet Explorer 8 (except Internet Explorer 6 for supported 
editions of Windows Server 2003) are affected. Exploit code 
analyzed by HBGary reveals that only Internet Explorer 6 
was targeted during Operation Aurora. This vulnerability can 
be leveraged by attackers of varying skill levels due to the

public availability of the Metasploit module “ie_aurora.rb”. 
The exploit code used by the original attackers was quickly 
improved and added to Metasploit thus greatly expanding the 
potential number of attackers and reliability of code. 

The JavaScript performs a heap spray attack and injects 

the embedded shellcode described below. The JavaScript 
exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer by copying, 
releasing, and then referencing a Document Object Model 
(DOM) element.

The shellcode exists as a Unicode escaped variable (sc) 
in the malicious JavaScript listed below. Upon successful 
exploitation of Internet Explorer, the shellcode will download 
an obfuscated second stage executable from http://demo1.
ftpaccess.cc/demo/ad.jpg which is the dropper. Note: these 
fi les are specifi c to the sample we analyzed at HBGary, Inc. 
The attackers must use a second stage download mechanism 
to achieve full system access due to memory constraints. It 
is unlikely that the fi nal payload could be delivered through 
the original exploit given these conditions. The dropper 
is XOR encrypted with a 0x95 key. The shellcode copies 
this encrypted binary to the user’s AppData directory as 
“a.exe”. The shellcode then decrypts “a.exe” and moves it 
to “b.exe” in the same directory. Then “b.exe” is executed. 
The following actionable intelligence can be used to identify 
exploit remnants in the heap space of Internet Explorer post 
exploitation attempt. These patterns can be searched for 
when doing memory analysis 
of a victim system.

DROPPER

The initial dropper is merely a detonation package that 

decompresses an embedded DLL into the Windows system32 
directory and loads it as a service. The initial dropper is likely 
to be packed (UPX, etc). The dropper has an embedded DLL 
that is decompressed to the windows system32 directory. This 
DLL will be named to resemble existing services (rasmon.
dll, etc). In order to evade forensics, the fi le-time of the 
dropped DLL will be modifi ed to match that of an existing 
system DLL (user32.dll, etc). The dropped DLL is loaded into 
its own svchost.exe process. Several registry keys are created 
and then deleted as part of this process. Finally, the dropper 
deletes itself from the system by using a dissolving batch fi le 
(DFS.BAT, etc).

two-stage installation. 
During stage one, the 
dropper will install the 
payload as a service 
running under the 
name Ups??? (where 
??? are three random characters). Once executing, the 
payload will immediately delete the fi rst service and enter 
stage-two. During stage-two, the payload will register a new, 
second service under the name RaS??? (where ??? are three 
random characters). This new service will point to the same 
backdoor DLL, no new fi les are involved. Note: the three 
character prefi xes Ups and RaS can easily be modifi ed by 
the attacker.

Once the new service is registered, the payload will access 
an embedded resource that is encrypted. The decryption goes 
through several phases. The encrypted data block contains 
the DNS name for the command and control server (homeunix.
com, etc). This data block is confi gurable before the malware 
is deployed. The data block length is hard-coded (0x150 or 
336 bytes). During phase one, this data block is fed through 
a simple XOR (0x99), resulting in an ASCII-string. Next, the 
resulting ASCII-string is fed into a base64 decoding function, 
producing a binary string. Finally, the resulting base64 
decoded binary string is fed through another XOR (0xAB), 
resulting in clear-text. The three primary encryption loops are 
colored and marked in Figure 1. The resulting clear-text buffer 
contains several fi elds in both ASCII and UNICODE, including 
the C&C server address.

COMMAND AND CONTROL

The payload communicates with its command and control

While outbound traffi c appears to be HTTPS, the actual traffi c 
uses a weak custom encryption scheme. The command and 
control packets have a very specifi c format.iv

The payload section is encrypted with a key selected by 

using GetTickCount. This means each infected node has its own 
key. The key is embedded in the header of the packet, and is 
easily recovered. 

DIAGNOSE
HOW THE MALWARE WORKS

The primary control logic can be found in the module 
registered under the service key (rasmon.dll, etc.). This 
module has been written in c and includes several specifi c 
methods and encodings that provide forensic track-ability.

The above screenshot illustrates a REcon™ trace on the 

malware dropper and subsequent service creation. Location 
A. represents the dropper program, which unpacks itself 
and decompresses a fi le to the system32 directory. Point B. 
represents the initial svchost.exe startup, which is loading the 
malware payload. Location C. is the actual execution of the 
malware service, which remains persistent. At points E. and F. 
you can see the malware checking in with the command and 
control server. Finally, location D. represents the dissolvable 
batch fi le which deletes the initial dropper and then itself.

CAPABILITY

The malware has generic and fl exible capabilities. There are 

distinct command handlers in the malware that allow fi les to 
be stolen and remote commands to be executed. The command 
handler is illustrated in Figure 2. At location A. the command 
number is checked. At locations marked B. are each individual 
command handler, as controlled by the C&C server and command

each command is sent back to the C&C server.

COPYCATS AND VARIANTS

With the release of MS10-002, and the subsequent 

integration with Metasploit, the exploit vector used with 
Aurora has been adopted laterally within the malware 
development economy.  Therefore, the use of MS10-002 
should not be construed as an Aurora infection without 
further analysis of the dropped payload.  Forensic toolmarks 
and link analysis have revealed several different threat 
groups who are employing common IE exploit vectors.  
HBGary is currently tracking several groups who operate 
malware systems of this nature.  

HBGary is using forensic toolmarks to trace the source 

code origins of binary malware samples dropped in 
conjunction with the MS10-002 exploit vector. For example, 
in Figure 3, link analysis is being used to track the identity 
of a threat actor in conjunction with his known Digital 
DNA™. HBGary’s Digital DNA™ database not only codifi es the 
behavior of software, but also the coding idioms, algorithms, 
and methods of individual developers.  In this way, individual 
threat actors can be tracked with Digital DNA™.   

In the example, link analysis is provided by Palantir™. The 
screenshot illustrates only a subset of the data being tracked 
by HBGary, and sensitive information has been redacted.   

At location 1. is a dropper obtained from an exploit server 
directly accessed from the extracted shellcode from a MS10-
002 JavaScript vector. Location 2. represents a forensic 
toolmark within the dropped executable.  This toolmark 
was obtained using physical memory assessment of the live 
executable, after it was allowed to unpack itself in a virtual 
machine.  This assessment was performed with HBGary 
Responder™.  At location 3., the recovered toolmark(s) were 
researched against published source code artifacts on the 
Internet.  From this, a single posting was discovered with 
this exact toolmark, and this posting exists only in one place 
and is of Chinese origin. From this, the author of the source 
code was determined to be XXXXXXXX. At location 4., all 
social cyberspaces used by XXXXXXX were then enumerated.  
From this, postings in Traditional and Simplifi ed Chinese 
were discovered that confi rm that XXXXXX is the author 
and supplier of a malware package known as ‘NB’ or ‘Netbot 
Attacker’.  Within the social space around ‘Netbot Attacker’ 
are individuals who are testing and/or asking for technical 
support regarding the malware package operation.  These 
individuals have been grouped within Palantir™ as ‘technical 
support for bot’ at location 5.

Figure 3. Link Analysis of Malware Actors using Palantir™

The above process, when carried further, produces many 
more social links.  Attribution such as this allows resolution 
and visibility into the intent of individual threat groups.

DIGITAL DNA INOCULATION SHOT

HBGary has prepared an inoculation shot for this malware. 

The inoculation shot is a small, signed binary that will allow 
you to scan for, and optionally remove, this malware from 
your Enterprise network.  The aurora innoculation shot can be 
downloaded from www.hbgary.com.

When the aurora innoculation shot is executed it will query 

the user for authentication credentials. Optionally the user 
can just hit “cancel” to  use the currently logged on USER’s 
authentication token. Some sample usages are listed below.

To scan a single machine:
AuroraInnoculation.exe -scan 192.168.0.1 
AuroraInnoculation.exe -scan MYBOXNAME

To scan multiple machines:
AuroraInnoculation.exe -range 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.254

To automatically attempt a clean operation:
AuroraInnoculation.exe -range 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.254 -clean

To scan a list of machines in a .txt fi le:

MCAFEE EPO CUSTOMERS
 DETECTION OF AURORA THREATS WITH DIGITAL DNA FOR EPO

  Customers of McAfee ePolicy Orchastrator, integrated 

with Digital DNA, can detect emerging advanced persistent 
threats.  To detect Aurora, users should perform a Digital 
DNA Sequence search with the above mentioned sequence 
for Aurora, and set a fuzzy match of 90% or greater.  Once 
machines are detected, the user is encouraged to use the 
freely available inoculation shot to remove the infection.

RESPOND

Several Enterprise products have the capability to scan 

for and potentially remove the Aurora malware. Detection of 
the malware is covered in detail, from multiple aspects, in 
the Detect section above. When using a Digital DNA™ capable 
platform such as McAfee ePO, you can search the Enterprise 
for the following Digital DNA sequence (recommend a tight 
match, 90% or higher).

DIGITAL DNA SEQUENCE FOR AURORA MALWARE

01 B4 EE 00 AE DA 00 8C 16 00 89 22 00 46 73 00 C6 49 00 0B AE 01 E7 9F

01 29 67 01 35 99

To thwart command and control and prevent data loss, 

known C&C domains should be blocked at the egress fi rewall. 
The domains listed in the Detect section represent a 
signifi cant set of those currently known to be operating. IDS 
signatures similar to the one illustrated in the Detect section 
should be used to detect inbound exploit attempts, and 
machines accepting this data should be scanned for potential 
infections. Many A/V products now contain signatures for the 
Aurora exploit and will be effective in detection and removal. 
However, the attackers that represent the threat will not be 
deterred, and variants of the attack are nearly assured.

FACTORS

C&C protocol

Installation and Deployment

DESCRIPTION

If a variant is developed, it will very 
likely use the same C&C protocol, but 
may change the header of the packet 
and the constants used for connection 
setup. This will evade IDS / Firewall 
rules designed to detect the current 
scheme. It is unlikely the attackers will 
change the encryption setup, however.

The method used to install the service 
is highly effective. Although the 
fi lenames will likely change, the actual 
method will likely remain.
