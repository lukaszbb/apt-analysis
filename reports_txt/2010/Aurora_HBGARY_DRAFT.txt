Cyber Espionage is a critical issue.    Over 80% of intellectual property is stored online digitally.   
The computing infrastructure in a typical Enterprise is more vulnerable to attack than ever 
before.    Current security solutions are proving ineffective at stopping cyber espionage.   
Malware is the single greatest problem in computer security today.    Yet, malware represents 
only the tip of the spear.    The true threat is the human being who is operating the malware.   
This human, or the organization he represents, is the true threat that is targeting information for 
the purposes of financial gain, theft of state secrets, and theft of intellectual property.    True 
threat intelligence requires reaching beyond malware infections to identify the individuals, 
country of origin, and intent of the attacker. 

 
 

 

 

   
 
 
 

THREAT SUMMARY 
The Aurora malware operation was identified recently and made public by Google and McAfeei.   
This malware operation has been associated with intellectual property theft including source 
code and technical diagrams (CAD, oil exploration bid-data, etc).    Companies hit have been 
publically speculated, including Google, Adobe, Yahoo, Symantec, Juniper Systems, Rackspace, 
Northrop Grumman, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Dow Chemical. The malware package 
used with Aurora is mature and been in development since at least 2006.   
 
The Aurora operation is characterized by a remotely operated backdoor program that persists on 
a Windows computer.    This backdoor program has several capabilities that are outline below. 

K E Y   F I N D I N G S  

Evidence collected around the malware operation suggest that Operation Aurora is simply an 
example of highly effective malware penetration.    There is not significant evidence to attribute 
the operation directly to the Chinese Government.    However, a key actor has been identified in 
association with Operation Aurora. 
 

Aspect 
Target 

Origin 

Description 
The operation is targeting intellectual property with no specific industry focus.   
This is an example of "not knowing what they are looking for until they find it". 
It is highly probable that the malware was developed in native Chinese language, 
and the operation control system is designed for Chinese users, indicating the entire 
operation is Chinese.    This does not, however, mean the Chinese Government is 
using the system. 

Developers  Forensic tool-marks in the CRC algorithm can be traced to Chinese origin.    That, 

combined with domain registration information, leads to at least one potential actor, 
Peng Yongii. The malware has been in development since at least 2006. It has been 
updated several times. 

Operators  Operators of the malware appear to use certain domains for C&C control.   

Intent 
Coms 

Dynamic DNS is a key feature of the operation, with many known C&C servers 
operating from domains registered through Peng Yong's 3322.org service. 
The primary intent is the theft of intellectual property.   
Communication is encrypted over HTTP, port 443, obfuscated with a weak 
encryption scheme.    The C&C servers tend to operate from domains hosted on 
dynamic DNS. 

A T T R I B U T I O N  

At this time, there is very little available in terms of attribution.    A CRC algorithm tends to 
indicate the malware package is of Chinese origin, and many attacks are sourced out of a service 
called 3322.org - a small company operating out of Changzhou.    The owner is Peng Yong, a 
Mandarin speaker who may have some programming background with such algorithms.      His 
dynamic DNS service hosts over 1 million domain names.    Over the last year, HBGary has 
analyzed thousands of distinct malware samples that communicate with 3322.org.    While Peng 
Yong is clearly tolerant of cyber crime operating through his domain services, this does not 
indicate he has any direct involvement with Aurora.

DETECT  
This section of the report details how you can detect Operation Aurora in your Enterprise.    The exploit and payload 
vehicle consists of the following components: 

• 

• 

• 

Javascript based exploit vector, known to exploit IE 6 
Shellcode component, embedded in the Javascript 
Secondary payload server that delivers a dropper 

•  The dropper itself, which only used once and then deleted 
•  The backdoor program which is decompressed from the dropper 

J A V A S C R I P T   A N D   S H E L L C O D E  

The JavaScript based attack vector associated with Operation Aurora was published in the public domain in early January 
2010.    Microsoft details the vulnerability in Security Bulletin MS10-002.    Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6, 
Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 (except Internet Explorer 6 for supported 
editions of Windows Server 2003) are affected.    Exploit code analyzed by HBGary reveals that only Internet Explorer 6 
was targeted during Operation Aurora.    This vulnerability can be leveraged by attackers of varying skill levels due to the 
public availability of the Metasploit module “ie_aurora.rb” .    The exploit code used by the original attackers was quickly 
improved and added to Metasploit thus greatly expanding the potential number of attackers and reliability of code.     
 
The JavaScript performs a heap spray attack and injects the embedded shellcode described below.    The JavaScript 
exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer by copying, releasing, and then referencing a Document Object Model 
(DOM) element.

The shellcode exists as a Unicode escaped variable (sc) in the malicious JavaScript listed below.    Upon successful 
exploitation of Internet Explorer, the shellcode will download an obfuscated second stage executable from 
http://demo1.ftpaccess.cc/demo/ad.jpg which is the dropper. Note: these files are specific to the sample we analyzed at 
HBGary, Inc. The attackers must use a second stage download mechanism to achieve full system access due to memory 
constraints.    It is unlikely that the final payload could be delivered through the original exploit given these conditions.   
The dropper is XOR encrypted with a 0x95 key.    The shellcode copies this encrypted binary to the user’s AppData 
directory as “a.exe”.    The shellcode then decrypts “a.exe” and moves it to “b.exe” in the same directory.    Then “b.exe” is 
executed. The following actionable intelligence can be used to identify exploit remnants in the heap space of Internet 
Explorer post exploitation attempt.    These patterns can be searched for when doing memory analysis of a victim system.

The initial dropper is merely a detonation package that decompresses an embedded DLL into the Windows system32 
directory and loads it as a service.    The initial dropper is likely to be packed (UPX, etc). The dropper has an embedded 
DLL that is decompressed to the windows system32 directory.    This DLL will be named to resemble existing services 
(rasmon.dll, etc). In order to evade forensics, the file-time of the dropped DLL will be modified to match that of an 
existing system DLL (user32.dll, etc).    The dropped DLL is loaded into its own svchost.exe process.    Several 
registry keys are created and then deleted as part of this process.    Finally, the dropper deletes itself from the system by 
using a dissolving batch file (DFS.BAT, etc).

The payload uses two-stage installation.    During stage one, the dropper will install 
the payload as a service running under the name Ups??? (where ??? are three 
random characters).    Once executing, the payload will immediately delete the first 
service and enter stage-two.    During stage-two, the payload will register a new, 
second service under the name RaS??? (where ??? are three random characters).   
This new service will point to the same backdoor DLL, no new files are involved. 
Note: the three character prefixes Ups and RaS can easily be modified by the attacker. 
Once the new service is registered, the payload will access an embedded resource 
that is encrypted.    The decryption goes through several phases.    The encrypted data block contains the DNS name for 
the command and control server (homeunix.com, etc).    This data block is configurable before the malware is 
deployed.    The data block length is hard-coded (0x150 or 336 bytes).    During phase one, this data block is fed through a 
simple XOR (0x99), resulting in an ASCII-string. Next, the resulting ASCII-string is fed into a base64 decoding 
function, producing a binary string.    Finally, the resulting base64 decoded binary string is fed through another XOR 
(0xAB), resulting in clear-text.    The three primary encryption loops are colored and marked in Figure 1. The resulting 
clear-text buffer contains several fields in both ASCII and UNICODE, including the C&C server address.

RES POND  
Several Enterprise products have the capability to scan for and potentially remove the Aurora malware.    Detection of the 
malware is covered in detail, from multiple aspects, in the Detect section above.    When using a Digital DNA(tm) capable 
platform such as McAfee ePO, Guidance EnCase Enterprise, or Verdasys Digital Guardian, you can search the Enterprise 
for the following Digital DNA sequence (recommend a tight match, 90% or higher). 
 
Digital DNA Sequence for Aurora Malware 
01 B4 EE 00 AE DA 00 8C 16 00 89 22 00 46 73 00 C6 49 00 0B AE 01 E7 9F 04 05 81 
01 0E DF 01 79 D8 00 25 6A 00 15 49 00 47 22 00 4B 67 0F 2D CC 01 29 67 01 35 99 
 
To thwart command and control and prevent data loss, known C&C domains should be blocked at the egress firewall.   
The domains listed in the Detect section represent a significant set of those currently known to be operating.    IDS 
signatures similar to the one illustrated in the Detect section should be used to detect inbound exploit attempts, and 
machines accepting this data should be scanned for potential infections.    Many A/V products now contain signatures for 
the Aurora exploit and will be effective in detection and removal.    However, the attackers that represent the threat will 
not be deterred, and variants of the attack are nearly assured. 
 
Factors 
C&C protocol 

Description 
If a variant is developed, it will very likely use the same C&C protocol, but 
may change the header of the packet and the constants used for connection 
setup.  This will evade IDS / Firewall rules designed to detect the current 
scheme.  It is unlikely the attackers will change the encryption setup, 
however. 
The method used to install the service is highly effective.  Although the 
filenames will likely change, the actual method will likely remain. 

Installation and Deployment 

 

I N O C U L A T I O N   S H O T  

HBGary has prepared an inoculation shot for this malware.    The inoculation shot is a small, signed binary 
that will allow you to scan for, and optionally remove, this malware from your Enterprise network. 
 

Remediation and Prevention with the HBGary Inoculation Shot 
The AuroraInnoculation.exe is a simple WMI-based utility for scanning windows-based machines for the presence of the Aurora APT malware package. 
The aurora innoculator also has the option of automatically removing a discovered infection and rebooting the box automatically. When the aurora 
innoculator is executed it will query the user for authentication credentials. Optionally the user can just hit "cancel" to    use the currently logged on 
USER's authentication token. Some sample usages are listed below. 
To scan a single machine: 
AuroraInnoculation.exe -scan 192.168.0.1 or AuroraInnoculation.exe -scan MYBOXNAME 
To scan multiple machines: 
AuroraInnoculation.exe -range 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.254 
To automatically attempt a clean operation: 
AuroraInnoculation.exe -range 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.254 -clean 
To scan a list of machines in a .txt file: 
AuroraInnoculation.exe -list targets.txt
