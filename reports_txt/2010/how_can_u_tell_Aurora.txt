How Can I Tell if I Was

 McAfee Labs identified a zero-day 
vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 
that was used as an entry point for 
“Operation Aurora” to exploit Google and at 
least 30 other companies. 

How can I tell if my systems were 
infected? 

If you are a McAfee VirusScan Engine 
customer, verify that you are using .DAT 
5864 released on January 18, 2010 
(McAfee has provided protection to identify 
this as of release 5862 and is updating as 
we continue to debug the attack) and 
perform a full scan on all machines within 
your enterprise, starting with most sensitive 
servers. If you detect the following 
signatures triggered: Exploit-Comele, 
Roarur.dr or Roarur.dll, you very likely have 
an infected Aurora host and should reach 
out toMcAfee Foundstone, our vulnerability 
management and protection services division, 
for onsite Incident Response Services. You 
may also take advantage of McAfee’s free 
Stinger product, used to clean up an Operation 
Aurora-infected system. 

If I’m not a McAfee customer… 

If you are not a McAfee Virus Scan Engine 
customer and your anti-malware vendor 
does not provide comprehensive detection 
for Aurora binaries, you can perform 
filename and md5 hash searches on your 
servers to determine if you have any 
matches that way. You should ensure that 
the md5 hash matches along with the 
filename to avoid false positives, as the 
filenames themselves are not unique and 
are very common Windows OS and other 
legitimate program filenames. The list of 
files and hashes is as follows:
