Overview 
 

Combating Aurora 

“Operation Aurora,” released the week of January 11, exploits the recent Microsoft 
Internet Explorer vulnerability. The attack was initially targeted at several large 
companies, including Google. It is now public and is available on the web. The public 
release significantly increases the possibility of widespread attacks exploiting the 
vulnerability, putting Internet Explorer users at potentially serious risk. 

Microsoft is aware of the targeted attacks and lists the following combinations as 
vulnerable: Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 
4, and Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on supported 
editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, 
Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

Below we have a summary of McAfee’s assessment of Internet Explorer and platform 
risks:  

 

 

 

* DEP 

 

 

2 

 

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a set of hardware and software technologies that 
perform additional checks on memory to help prevent malicious code from running 
on a system. In Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Microsoft 
Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, DEP is enforced by hardware and by software. 

The primary benefit of DEP is to help prevent code execution from data pages. 
Typically, code is not executed from the default heap and the stack. Hardware-
enforced DEP detects code that is running from these locations and raises an 
exception when execution occurs. Software-enforced DEP can help prevent malicious 
code from taking advantage of exception-handling mechanisms in Windows.

Exploit-Comele 

This maliciously crafted script attempts to exploit the vulnerability when Internet 
Explorer handles certain DOM operations. 

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute remote code. 

http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_253210.htm 

 

Roarur.dr 

This Trojan drops further malicious files onto the victim’s computer. 

http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_253415.htm 

 

 

Roarur.dll 

This Trojan is dropped by the roarur.dr Trojan. 

The dll creates an additional service on the victim’s computer and checks for certain files 
on the system. The files it looks for are

•  acelpvc.dll (presence of this file does not necessarily imply an infection ) . acelpvc.dll 
is used to stream live desktop feeds to the attacker 
 

•  VedioDriver.dll (presence of this file does not necessarily imply an infection )- Helper 
dll for acelpvc.dll

Description 

A memory corruption vulnerability in some versions of Microsoft Internet 
Explorer may lead to remote code execution or an application crash. The 
flaw lies in Internet Explorer's handling of certain DOM operations. 
Exploitation can occur via a maliciously crafted file or a maliciously crafted 
web page and allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Failed exploit 
attempts may result in an application crash (denial of service).  

Importance 

High. On January 14 Microsoft publicly disclosed this vulnerability. Active 
exploitation has been observed in the wild.

Cleaning and Repair 
 
A full on-demand scan must run to completely clean an infected host. In some cases, it 
may also be necessary to run the on-demand scan in Safe Mode, as well as run a second 
scan after a reboot. It is critical that the on-demand scan be configured properly.  
 
The proper configuration: 

•  Scan All Local Drives 
•  Memory for Rootkits 
•  Running Processes 
•  Registry 
•  First “Action” set to “Clean” 

 
The full, recommended process: 

•  Launch a full on-demand scan with the prior-documented configuration 
•  Allow the scan to run to completion 
•  Reboot 
•  Launch a second on-demand scan and allow it to run to completion to verify that 

the system has been cleaned
