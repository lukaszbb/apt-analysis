Backdoor.Winnti attackers have a skeleton in
their closet?

New evidence suggests that the skeleton key malware, known as Trojan.Skelky, could be linked to the
Backdoor.Winnti malware family.

On January 12, 2015, Dell Secureworks blogged about a tool (Trojan.Skelky) that allows attackers to
â€œuse a password of their choosing to authenticate as any user.â€ The Skelky (from skeleton key)
tool is deployed when an attacker gains access to a victimâ€™s network; the attackers may also
utilize other tools and elements in their attack. 
Symantec has analyzed Trojan.Skelky and found that it may be linked to the Backdoor.Winnti
malware family. The attackers behind the Trojan.Skelky campaign appear to have been using the
malware in conjunction with this back door threat. Itâ€™s unclear if the malware family
Backdoor.Winnti is used by one attack group or many groups.
During our research, we also found that Trojan.Skelky has been active over the past two years. Within
this timeframe, we have seen new variants and a consistent hashed password value.
Where is Trojan.Skelky being used?

Symantec telemetry identiﬁed the skeleton key malware on compromised computers in ﬁve
organizations with ofﬁces in the United States and Vietnam. The exact nature and names of the
affected organizations is unknown to Symantec. The ﬁrst activity was seen in January 2013 and until
November 2013, there was no further activity involving the skeleton key malware. In November
2013, the attackers increased their usage of the tool and have been active ever since. Four more
variants of Trojan.Skelky were discovered as well as additional ﬁle names used by the attackers. The
complete set of observed ﬁle names and hashes are listed as follows

msuta64.dll: 66da7ed621149975f6e643b4f9886cfd

The link between Trojan.Skelky and Backdoor.Winnti
From the ﬁrst observed use of the tool in January 2013 to the present, the attackers have consistently
used the same password. This is the case with three different variants of the tool. The regular use of
the same password across multiple variants means itâ€™s likely that only one group of attackers has
been using the tool until at least January 2015. 
By identifying any other malware active on compromised computers at the same time as
Trojan.Skelky, it is possible to learn more about the attackers. There were almost no signs of other
malware active at the same time as Skelky in most of the organizations investigated. However, two
compromised computers had other malware present, active, and in the same directory, at the same
time as Trojan.Skelky. 
Two ﬁles were discovered on one of the victimâ€™s computers. One ﬁle is a variant of
Backdoor.Winnti (jqs.exe) and the other is a dropper for Backdoor.Winnti (tmp8296.tmp), which is
responsible for creating the Backdoor.Winnti sample. Details on the ﬁle names and hashes are as
follows:

jqs.exe (Backdoor.Winnti dropper): 600b604784594e3339776c6563aa45a1
tmp8296.tmp (Backdoor.Winnti variant): 48377c1c4cfedebe35733e9c3675f9be

Backdoor.Winnti has been used in the past in a number of different campaigns, most notably against
Asian games companies. Given the disparate nature of some victims, itâ€™s unclear if the malware
is used by one set of attackers, or many. Symantec is continuing its investigation into this malware
familyBackdoor.Winnti and the speciﬁc actors behind the combined use of Backdoor.Winnti and
Trojan.Skelky.
