Analysis of Project Cobra

Project Cobra and the Carbon System were mentioned by Kaspersky in the article called
“The Epic Turla Operation” . This malware is used by the same actors as Uroburos (aka
Snake/Turla) and Agent.BTZ. We estimate that Carbon System was developed after
Agent.BTZ and before Uroburos. The Carbon System shares some technical details with
Uroburos and Agent.BTZ (encryption key, encryption algorithm, design, …) and some
other links, such as the name of the snake-related project: Cobra. Uroburos could be
considered as a kernel centric “snake” and Cobra Carbon System as a userland centric
“snake”.

One specification of the group behind this threat is the fact that when they developed new tools, the old
ones are not destroyed or abandoned but still maintained and used. Thanks to our collection of samples
we are able to draw the following timeline:

The Cobra can be considered as an extensible framework. This framework is generally downloaded and
dropped by a reconnaissance malware for example Tavdig, aka Wipbot (Symantec) or also Epic Backdoor
(Kaspersky). The following schema illustrates the “modus opandi” used by the Uroburos actors:

 
Using IOC (Indicators of Compromise) to detect this malware is quite complicated, because the malware
authors made efforts to randomize many factors. For example, the attackers drop the malware into
different directories, using the files present, also chosen randomly, to store the malware configuration.

Due to these characteristics, the experts of the G DATA SecurityLabs decided to publish an analysis of the
framework dropped by the file with the md5: cb1b68d9971c2353c2d6a8119c49b51f. G DATA security
solutions detect this file as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and Win32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).

We can find the compilation path in a file embedded in the
dropper:f:\Workshop\Projects\cobra\carbon_system\x64\Release\carbon_system.pdb

Looking at this, we can easily identify that “Carbon System” is a part of the “Cobra” project.

Dropper

The dropper is used to install four files on the infected system. The dropped files are stored in the
resources of the binary. The dropper has the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of the executable files
embedded. It installs the following files:

miniport.dat: configuration file;
stage 1: the file name is randomly chosen from ipvpn.dll,srsvc.dll or kmsvc.dll. This library is
registered as a service;
stage 2: the file name is msimghlp.dll. It’s the orchestrator of the malware (called “system” by the
author);
stage 3: the file name is msximl.dll. This library (called “user” by the authors) is injected in the

browsers and the email clients in order to communicate to the outside via web requests.

The persistence is performed by the creation of a service (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Service\).
The service name depends on the chosen stage 1 file name:

Stage 1 is always installed in %SystemRoot%\system32\ To install something into %SystemRoot%, the
attackers have to have gained administration privileges before they executed the dropper. The three other
dropped files are stored in an existing directory in %ProgramFiles%, randomly chosen.

During the installation, executed in a command line, the dropper displays the following information:

 
The screenshot shows the string “LUCKY STRIKE!!!”, displayed in case the installation was carried out

successfully and “Idioten???” in case of any installation error. To be able to find the random installation
path, the dropper modifies a legitimate .inf file (also chosen randomly) in %SystemRoot%\inf\ to add the
following information to the end of the file:

[B8744A58]root=C:\Program Files\Windows NT\Accessoiries\en-US

The ID between the brackets is a unique ID and the root variable contains the path in which the three
additional files are installed.

The tricks put in place by the authors – random file names and random installation paths – are used to
limit the detection possible with Indicators of Compromise. Generally, security researchers use these
kinds of artifacts in order to detect the compromise of systems.

Stage 1: loader

MD5: 43e896ede6fe025ee90f7f27c6d376a4G DATA security solutions detect this as
Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and     Win32.Trojan.Cobra.A (Engine B).

The first stage is rather small as the number of instructions and actions is rather small. Simply spoken, its
purpose is to load the second stage. To perform this task, the first stage checks all of the files in
%SystemRoot%\inf\ in order to find the entry with the unique ID previously mentioned and therefore to
determine the path for stage 2. After that, the library of the second stage is loaded and, subsequently, the
exported function ModuleStart() is executed:

 

Stage 2: the orchestrator

Md5: e6d1dcc6c2601e592f2b03f35b06fa8f
Version: 3.71
G DATA security solutions detect this threat as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and
Win32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).

The second stage is called “system” by the authors of the malware. The internal name of the library is
carbon_system.dll.

The purpose of this code is to stay in background and orchestrate several requests and tasks made by the
other .dlls or named pipe connections.

Mutex creation

The orchestrator creates several mutexes. These mutexes are used for two reasons:

used by the third stage in order to detect whether the orchestrator has been launched correctly on
the infected system;
used to execute the orchestrator only once.

Here are the created mutexes:

Global\MSCTF.Shared.MUTEX.zRX
Global\DBWindowsBase
Global\IEFrame.LockDefaultBrowser
Global\WinSta0_DesktopSessionMut
Global\{5FA3BC02-920F-D42A-68BC-04F2A75BE158}
Global\SENS.LockStarterCacheResource
Global\ShimSharedMemoryLock

Working files and directories

Here are the working files and directories used by the orchestrator. The orchestrator creates one single
random path and then stores all necessary folders mentioned under this one randomly generated path:

%randompath%\Nls\: directory related to the tasks to be executed
%randompath%\0208\: directory related to the temporary files
%randompath%\System\: directory related to the additional plugins
%randompath%\System\bootmisc.sdi: seems not to be used
%randompath%\0208\C_56743.NLS: files related to the tasks to be executed and the plugins

%randompath%\Nls\b9s3coff.ax: files related to the tasks to be executed and the named pipe
%randompath%\Nls\a67ncodc.ax: file related to the tasks to be executed
%randompath%\vndkrmn.dic: log file
%randompath%\qavsrc.dat: log file
%randompath%\miniport.dat: configuration file
%randompath%\asmcerts.rs: purpose currently unknown
%randompath%\getcert.rs: purpose currently unknown

The files are not automatically created during the startup of the malware. The files are created only if the
orchestrator needs them.

Configuration file

The configuration file (miniport.dat) is used by the second and the third stage. The file is encrypted with
the CAST-128 algorithm, the same algorithm that has been used by Uroburos to encrypt the file systems.
The encryption key is: 
{ 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9a, 0xbc, 0xde, 0xf0, 0xfe, 0xfc,  0xba, 0x98, 0x76, 0x54, 0x32, 0x10 }
Note: following the logic, 0xfc would be expected to be 0xdc.

Here is an example of the configuration file:

The file format is the same as the .ini file format from Windows. The authors use the Windows API to
parse the configuration (GetPrivateProfileStringA()).The file contains:

A unique ID to identify the infected machine (object_id);
The command and control server used by stage 3 (addressX);
The version of the “system” and the “user” library (in [VERSION]);
The frequency and time of execution of several internal tasks ([TIME]);
The name of the named pipe used as communication channel between the “system” and the “user”
(system_pipe);
The process name where stage 3 will be injected (iproc);
…

Communication via named pipes

The orchestrator creates two named pipes in order to communicate with stage 3 or to receive messages
from an external machine:

\\.\\pipe\sdlrpc
\\.\\pipe\comnap (the name in the configuration file)

Features

The orchestrator creates nine threads in order to handle the different features. We will now have a look at
the most interesting threads.

One thread is used to check if the parameters in the configuration file have changed.

A second thread is used to check the available hard disk space. If the HDD space is low, the orchestrator
generates an entry in the log file:

 
The preceding screenshot reveals a rather interesting use of English, again. From what we can conclude,
we believe “Survive me” is supposed to mean something like “Rescue me” in the sense of “help me to
survive”.

A third thread is created in order to handle the tasks. A task is a command sent from the C&C that is to be
executed. The code to be executed is stored locally on the infected machine. The orchestrator is able to
execute libraries (by executing the export start()) or to execute Windows’ command line. The command
line can be execute with the current user privilege or with the privilege of another user (via
CreateProcessA() or CreateProcessAsUserA()):

 
A fourth thread is used to handle the log rotation file (vndkrmn.dic).

A fifth thread is used to create and read the data sent to the named pipes.

A sixth thread is used to load plugins. For the orchestrator a module is a library file with a specific export
called ModuleStart(). The plugin list is stored in the configuration file ([PLUGINS]). This thread is very
similar to the third thread, but is bares some minor differences. The function to execute the plugins is not
the same.

Finally a seventh thread is used to inject stage 3 (msximl.dll) into the browsers and email clients. The list
of the targeted processes is stored in the configuration file:
iproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe

As usual, the injected library is executed via the ModuleStart() exports.

Log file

The orchestrator and stage 3 generate a shared log file. The file is encrypted with the same algorithm and
the same key as the configuration file. Here is an example of the content:

The log format is:Date|Time|Unique ID|source|message

The source can be:

S: stands for the orchestrator (or “System”);
U: stands for the injected library (or “User”).

The format of the message is not always the same. However, the first part is the executed feature:

ST: start (either for the orchestrator or the injected library); the second part of the message is the
version (for example 3.71 for the orchestrator and 3.62 for the injected library) and, regarding the
injected library, the name of the host process;
STOP: stop;
OPER: message for the operator (for example when the disk space is low);
W: web requests;
INJ: injection; the second part of the message is the path of the file (lib) used to be injected into e.g.
the browser or the PID;
L: load library log message;
S: log rotation message;
T: message linked to the task execution;

Stage 3: the injected library

Md5: 554450c1ecb925693fedbb9e56702646  
Version: 3.62
This threat is detected by G DATA security solutions as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and
Win32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).

Stage 3 is called “user” by the authors. The internal name of the library is CARBON.dll.The purpose of this
stage is to communicate to the outside via web requests. The communication is used to ex-filtrate data and
to receive orders (or plugins or code to execute).

Mutex check

The first task of stage 3 is to check whether the mutexes created by the orchestrator are available or not, to
make sure the orchestrator has started correctly:

 

Check of the Internet connection

Before communicating with the command and control server, stage 3 checks whether an Internet
connection is available by contacting:

www.google.com
www.yahoo.com
www.bing.com
update.microsoft.com
windowsupdate.microsoft.com
microsoft.com

In case the connection does not work, the following message is written into the log
file:|u|W|-1|0|ALL|NOINET|

Communication to the command & controls

The communication to the operators is performed via the URL stored in the configuration file.

Firstly, the malware performs a GET request in order to identify whether the C&C is up and running.

If the first query is a success, a second request is sent to the C&C with the difference that some data is
included into an HTTP Cookie. The content of the cookie is catid, task, id, forumid, itemid, link, layout,
start, limit (none of the parameters is mandatory). The data sent in this cookie is encrypted, using the
CAST-128 algorithm, and encoded.

The malware can also generate POST requests. Here is an example of the pattern:POST hxxp://%s/%s?
uid=%d&context=%s&mode=text&data=%s

The malware uses the same technique as Tavdig does to receive orders.  The data can be seen between the
<div> and the </div> field in the following screenshot:

 

Additional features

Stage 3 is able to execute tasks, exactly as the orchestrator is. The code concerning the features is exactly
the same as the code the orchestrator uses. We assume that this is the case due to copy & paste. The “user”
is able to execute libraries (by executing the export start()) and to execute Windows command line. The
command line can be executed with the current user privilege or with the privilege of another user (via
CreateProcessA() or CreateProcessAsUserA()).

Conclusion

This analysis shows us that the actors behind Uroburos, Agent.BTZ and the Carbon System are skilled and
still active. This sample we analyzed demonstrates how the authors tried to complicate the detection and
the use of Indicators of Compromise. Summarized, some of the tricks we have encountered:

use of random service names;
us of random file names;
use of random installation directory names;

configuration of the named pipe name;
…

Carbon System is a real extensible framework with a plugin management. As these plugins are provided by
the contacted C&C servers, it can be anything – nothing has to be pre-bundled. Due to the nature of the
malware attacks, we can imagine those plugins to be anything connected to cyber espionage, from
keyloggers to credentials stealers, eavesdropping mechanisms and much more. An attacked enterprise or
organization would be an open book for the attackers.

The architecture is complex, with an orchestrator and a library injected into the browsers’ and email
clients’ processes. Obviously, this approach resembles what we have seen looking at Uroburos. The
framework could be considered as a “draft” but still very powerful version (in user-land only) of Uroburos.
We believe that Uroburos is the product of the Cobra malware evolution. Although Uroburos is a new
branch, not a linear follow-up.

Looking at the whole picture that we can draw until now, we can say that everything regarding this whole
campaign is highly professional. We have analyzed various samples and have drawn many conclusions.
Even though there are still many open questions that need to be answered, we come closer to charming
the snakes – The Cobra, the venomous animal with the deadly bite, and Uroburos, the self-sustaining
creepy mixture of a snake and a dragon. This kind of herpetology became quite interesting and we are
thrilled to find out more about the campaigns.
