Tibetan Uprising Day Malware Attacks 

Authors: Katie Kleemola, Masashi Crete-Nishihata and John Scott-Railton 

 

 

SUMMARY 
 

  Hundreds of members of the Tibetan community are being targeted by email-based malware attacks 

that leverage the March 10 Tibetan Uprising anniversary as a theme. 

  This report analyzes two March 10 related attacks. One using a new malware family we call 

“MsAttacker” that we have not observed before, and another using the ShadowNet malware family and 
command and control infrastructure related to previous campaigns known to have targeted the Tibetan 
community. 

  We include user recommendations for preventing infection and indicators of compromise for 

researchers to identify MsAttacker. 
 

BACKGROUND 
 
On March 10 1959, amidst growing unrest, Tibetans took to the streets of the capital Lhasa to protest the 
Chinese occupation of Tibet. Thousands surrounded the Potala Palace, then the home of His Holiness the 
Dalai Lama (HHDL), spurred by fears that he was to be arrested by the Chinese authorities. Following this 
event, escalation of tensions between Chinese and Tibetan forces led to HHDL escaping Tibet and taking up 
exile in northern India. 
 
The anniversary of the March 10 Tibetan Uprising is a major event in the Tibetan diaspora, commemorated 
with a day of protest around the world to raise awareness around Tibetan rights issues. It is a period of 
intensive activism and mobilization for many Tibetan organizations. 
 
In previous research, we described how attackers leverage the heightened activity around the event with social 
engineering campaigns, seeding targeted malware.  For example, we have found personalized e-mails that use 
references to the anniversary to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments. 
 
In this report we analyze two separate email-based targeted malware attacks that use the March 10 anniversary 
as a theme.

ATTACK 1: MSATTACKER 
 
On March 5 2015, an email with the subject line “10th March 2015 campaign for Tibet” was sent to hundreds 
of individuals and organizations from the Tibetan community. The email purported to come from a well-
known Tibetan NGO and contained information about a series of events planned to commemorate the 56th 
anniversary of the Tibetan Uprising. 
 
Attached to the email was a malicious Microsoft Word file “10th March.doc” that used the exploit CVE-2012-
0158, which is a vulnerability in how Microsoft Word handles RTF documents. This vulnerability has been 
patched since April 10, 2012 but has remained the most frequently used CVE we have observed in malware 
attacks against Tibetan groups for the last two years. Its repeated usage suggests that attackers are successfully 
compromising members of the community, because their systems do not have the latest software updates. 
The exploit was used to deliver a malware family that does not match any available signatures and has not 
been observed by us in previous attacks against the Tibetan community. 
 
The malware first connects to a command and control server (C2) 122.10.117.152 located in Guangzhou, 
China. 
 
The malware then downloads a stage 2 binary: [c2 ip]/download/ms/MiniJs.dll 
 
This file is copied to  c:\windows\system32\teamviewsvc.dll and creates a service to run on startup. It then 
connects to 23.27.127.200 to receive further requests. 
 
We call this family “MsAttacker” after an event name in the stage 2 binary. 
 
We were also provided with another sample of MsAttacker that was also sent on March 5 in a highly targeted 
attack against a Tibet-related NGO. The email contained information about a private event the group was 
planning that was unrelated to March 10 activities. The attachment contained the same payload as the first 
March 10 related attack. 
 
We found one other example of this malware in the wild. On March 5, an analysis of a file “WTO. non-market 
status China _1_.doc” was posted to Malwr (a community malware analysis platform). This sample was from 
the same family and also connected to 122.10.117.152. 
 
ATTACK 2: SHADOWNET 
 
In another attack on March 5, members of a Tibetan human rights organization received an email appearing to 
come from the group’s organizational mailing list. The email message contained information from the 
secretary of the Bureau of His Holiness the Dalai Lama regarding events related to March 10. Attached was a 
malicious Microsoft Word file that had the same filename as the previous attack (10th March.doc) and also 
used CVE-2012-0158. However, the malware used in this attack is from the ShadowNet family. 
 
ShadowNet malware leverages Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), a system tool meant for 
administrators. Its intended usage as a tool for collecting system information and automation makes it an ideal 
mechanism for gathering and exfiltrating data. The use of legitimate Windows features can make it more 
difficult for administrators to identify activity as malicious.

ShadowNet typically uses multi-layered C2 infrastructure that first connects to blog websites and then 
retrieves C2 information from encoded strings left on the blog. By using blog sites as intermediaries the 
attackers can maintain control of compromised machines even if a C2 is blocked by a network firewall or 
otherwise goes down. If a C2 needs to be updated the attackers can simply point the intermediaries to new 
servers. 
 
The sample used in this attack includes a WMI Script with links to three blogs 
(hxxp://johnsmith152.typepad.com/blog/rss.xml; hxxp://mynewshemm.wordpress.com/feed/; 
hxxp://johnsmith5382.thoughts.com/feed). The blogs contain an encoded string that points to the actual C2: 
hxxp://www.semamail.info/firex/test.php, which has the IP 122.10.117.5 and is on the same Autonomous 
System (AS 24544) as the C2 for the MsAttacker sample. Apart from this commonality and the timing of the 
attack we do not observe any other linkages between the MsAttacker and ShadowNet attacks. 
 
The domain (semamail.info) has questionable whois information: 

 
Registrant Name: Kasong Dolma 
Registrant Street: New York 
Registrant City:New York 
Registrant State/Province:guangdong 
Registrant Postal Code:10001 
Registrant Country:CN 
Registrant Phone:+1.9175608889 
Registrant Email: mike.fly@email.com 

 
This same registration information has been used for a number of other domains including 
conamail.info, convmail.info, and fifamp3.info. The domain fifamp3.info resolves to 122.10.117.35. Passive 
DNS records show that the same IP has pointed to rukiyeangel.dyndns.pro, which is related to C2 
infrastructure used in the Lucky Cat and TseringKanyaq campaigns.  ShadowNet was also used in both of 
these campaigns. The overlap between C2 infrastructure and malware families suggests some level of 
coordination between this new attack and the previous campaigns. 
 
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
These attacks are a reminder that members of the Tibetan community are consistently targeted, and that the 
threat seems to increase during important Tibetan events. 
 
These kinds of  attacks can be mitigated through greater user awareness and changes in behaviour. Users in 
targeted communities should always be cautious about unsolicited emails containing links or attachments and 
should carefully examine the email sender addresses in suspicious messages. 
 
Viewing documents through the Gmail preview feature, or by uploading them to Google Docs to view them 
can make it possible to look at the content of attachments without risking infection of a machine.  Suspicious 
files can also be submitted to VirusTotal (but should not be submitted if the files contain personal information) 
or shared with technical experts within the community. 
 
For further resources on digital security the Citizen Lab recommends Tibet Action Institute’s Be a Cyber 
Super Hero project. We are continuing to closely analyze these attacks and the MsAttacker malware family.
