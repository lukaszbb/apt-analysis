Introduction 
Over the past several months an increasing number of strategic web compromises (“wateringholes”) 
have been discovered on websites in Hong Kong. This rise in activity coincides with the Occupy 
Central protests. In this post we will talk about a single attack, whilst not trying to distract attention 
from the vast number of attacks and subsequent compromises that remain persistent in Hong Kong. 

Whilst going about our daily business we were alerted to a website that began serving a malicious 
payload alongside its usual web page. The initial investigation revealed that the attack and 
associated payloads are part of an ongoing attack campaign by an Advanced Persistent Threat group 
that is known to target various sectors of industry and Government in Hong Kong. 

In this instance we have chosen to obfuscate details of the compromised website to protect the 
identity of the victim. This website belongs to a private educational institution who, since being 
notified about the compromise, has removed the malicious executable and remediated the 
compromised of their server, thus breaking a crucial link in the chain of this attack. 

 

Strategic web compromise 
The website in question was implanted with some HTML code that simply reaches out to a 
secondary website and downloads malware. Whilst this in itself is not interesting the methodology 
used to obfuscate code and evade detection are. The underlying code in the first page that loads 
exploits a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2014-6332) and runs several scripts, each with 
support for different operating systems and methods of downloading and executing a file from a 
website. The first script is obfuscated Visual Basic Script (“VBS”) 

By decoding this we can see the true intentions of the script – which opens a whole new can of 
worms.

This code is extremely interesting because not only does it contain VBScript but also contains 
PowerShell script. Once running it uses an elaborate way to detect the operating system version and 
then selects whether to use VBScript or Powershell based on the result; VBScript for Windows XP 
and Powershell for newer versions of Windows. The Powershell script is compressed and Base64 
encoded. By decoding this script we can determine its nature 

 

As you can see this powershell script simply extracts another VBScript and executes it. The VBScript 
then downloads the first binary payload into the user’s temporary directory and names it ‘plug.exe’.  

If the operating system version is too old to support Powershell then the script will attempt to use 
VBScript. This VBScript downloads the primary payload to the temporary directory and names it 
“z1.exe”.

First stage malware (Dropper component – “Swisyn” part 1) 
The first binary payload that lands on the system is relatively simple and serves as a method of yet 
again detecting the operating system version and where to drop a secondary payload file. Whilst this 
binary is not complicated by nature it has been designed to masquerade as a legitimate application 
and contains functionality to evade anti-virus. This malware implant is commonly detected by anti-
virus as Swisyn. 

Upon running this malware determines the operating system version, but only delineating between 
Windows XP, Visa and above. 

It appears that this functionality is included because the secondary payload comes in both 32bit and 
64bit versions. 

Both of these second stage payloads are obfuscated but decoded with a simple bitwise operation as 
per below

In this scenario, the secondary payloads can be decoded using a simple subtraction of 3 followed by 
an XOR of 3 from each byte. This file is then written to %User%\Application Data\Microsoft in a 
newly created folder name ‘wuauclt’. The filename depends on the operating system version, for 
Windows XP it is “clbcatq.dll”, for Windows Vista and above it is “profapi.dll”.  Once this file has 
been written to disk a file from the Windows System32 folder is copied into the directory. This file, 
named ‘wuauclt.exe’, is the Windows update client interface and it a standard windows file. By 
executing this file in a specific manner it will load the freshly dropped DLL file – affectively this is 
known as DLL hijacking. 

Following this action another file, named ‘wuauclt.dat’, is written on to the disk under the same 
directory. This file is encoded and not decoded at this stage of the attack. To complete the file drop 
wuauclt.exe is executed.  

The 64bit version of this dropper is vastly similar in functionality although it offers slightly more 
efficiency in the code. The decoding routine is more simplified than its 32bit counterpart and the 
decoding key is hardcoded

The following pseudo-code can decode both 32bit and 64bit versions of the DLL stored in 
‘wuauclt.dat’ 

 

Not to dwell on a dropper, let’s move on to the second stage malware.  

 

 

Second stage (Decoder and loader – “Swisyn” part 2) 
The malware second stage is now loaded and running. Interestingly, this payload is also detected by 
anti-virus as Swisyn. This DLL is again fairly simple and acts as a secondary dropper. It primarily 
serves as a method of decoding one of the files dropped by the previous malware stage and creating 
a method to start the malware on system boot-up or user login. In order to do this the malware 
firstly decodes a file that was dropped by the previous stage – in this case it is “wuauclt.dat”. The 
decoding routine is again overly complex but ultimately amounts to a simple subtraction and XOR, 
again both of these operations are performed by the number 3, thus each byte is subtracted by 3 
and then XOR’d with 3

Once this file has been decoded it is loaded into memory and executed. This file, once decoded is 
the third and final payload. The method of leaving the encoded file on disk and only decoding it in 
memory is to thwart poorly configured anti-virus or disk surface heuristic scanners. 

Finally to wrap up, an entry is created in the registry named ‘wuauclt’ is created under 
‘HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Run’ to ensure that this file is executed upon 
user-login. 

 

 

Final stage (RAT – “PCClient”) 
Finally we are left with a full payload. Unsurprisingly the 3rd and final stage of this part of the attack 
is a fully fledged RAT (Remote Administration Tool), which is detected by anti-virus as PCClient. This 
RAT allows the attacker to control the infected workstation and perform a vast array of 
administrative functions such as: 

  Downloading files to the infected workstation 
  Uploading from the infected workstation files to the attackers 
  Enumerate/list all connected drives such as network shares or external devices 
  Search the infected workstations hard drive for files 
  Deleting, copying and moving files on the infected workstation 
  Executing commands on the infected workstation 

A high-level view of the command structure gives us an idea as to how simple this functionality 
can seem, but does not turn away from how damaging the affects can be:

Page 7 

Once the RAT has been loaded on the infected machine it begins calling out to the command and 
control server (“phoning home”) and waits for the attackers to issue one of the above 
commands to the victim. As we usually see with APT attacks the malware controllers use a 
specific ID to code their attack campaign, which in this case is ‘C00BBB’. 
Information about the victim system is collected and posted off to the command and control 
server. This information gives the attacker a brief description about the machine. The 
information consists of: 

 

  Machine hostname 
  Total amount of RAM memory 
  Operating system and service pack level 
  Attack campaign code 

This information is encoded using a simple bitwise operation and then sent to the command and 
control server. For example:

Whilst this may seem to make the data harder to recover it actually makes detection of the traffic 
easier. To decode the traffic a simple calculation can be performed by reversing the encoding 
operations. In this case the malware simply increases the initial encoding key by 1, then adds this 
value to each byte in the buffer and finally XOR’s each byte. Once again, the following pseudo-code 
can decode this data 

 

 

Infrastructure & associations 
During in the investigation we performed analysis of the infrastructure that this malware 
communicates with. On this occasion we have not been able to gain physical access to the command 
and control server as it is legitimate, but compromised production infrastructure. The graph below 
shows the flow in which various parts of the attack are loaded and how they chain together.

Detection & mitigation 
This attack can be detected and/or mitigated at each stage. In order to help organisations protect 
themselves we have created a number of network IDS rules and disk-scan rules that can be used 
with Snort and Yara. Rules are provided in a best-effort basis and we cannot vouch for their 
efficiency in your environment.
