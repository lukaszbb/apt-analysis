1. Executive Summary
From late 2013 onwards, several banks and financial institutions have been 
attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar 
modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement 
agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative 
losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. 
This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. 
The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly 
seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be financial gain as 
opposed to espionage. 
An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were 
achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking 
communications, with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet 
(.CPL) files attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to exploit kits 
website traffic that related to financial activity.
The email attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 
2010 (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE-2014-
1761). Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the shellcode decrypts 
and executes the backdoor known as Carbanak. 
Carbanak is a remote backdoor (initially based on Carberp), designed for 
espionage, data exfiltration and to provide remote access to infected machines. 
Once access is achieved, attackers perform a manual reconnaissance of the 
victim’s networks. Based on the results of this operation, the attackers use 
different lateral movement tools in order to get access to the critical systems 
in the victim´s infrastructure. They then install additional software such as the 
Ammyy Remote Administration Tool, or even compromise SSH servers. Notably, 
some of the latest versions of the analyzed Carbanak malware appear not to use 
any Carberp source code.
Once the attackers successfully compromise the victim´s network, the primary 
internal destinations are money processing services, Automated Teller Machines 
(ATM) and financial accounts. In some cases, the attackers used the Society for 
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network to transfer 
money to their accounts. In others, Oracle databases were manipulated to open 
payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer money between 

4

accounts using the online banking system. The ATM network was also used to 
dispense cash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready 
to collect it.
As part of the attack´s reconnaissance phase, video recordings of the activities of 
bank employees, particularly system administrators, were made. The videos were 
sent to the C2 server.
Please note that the attackers abused the aforementioned services by 
impersonating legitimate local users who had the permissions to perform the 
actions later reproduced by the cybercriminals. As far as we know, none of the 
aforementioned services were attacked nor was any specific vulnerability within 
them exploited.
Of the 100 banking entities impacted at the time of writing this report, at least 
half have suffered financial losses, with most of the victims located in Russia, 
USA, Germany, China and Ukraine. The magnitude of the losses is significant. 
For example, one victim lost approximately $7.3 million (USD) due to ATM fraud; 
another suffered a $10 million (USD) loss due to the exploitation of its online 
banking platform. 
Stolen funds were transferred out of the affected countries to bank accounts in 
the US and China. Additionally some of the C2 servers have log entries indicating 
connections to systems located in the US. Telemetry indicates that the attackers 
are expanding operations to other regions, such as Asia, the Middle-East, Africa 
and Europe.
This report discusses the attack vectors, infection mechanisms and toolkits used 
by the attackers to exploit the network after the initial infection, as well as the 
operational details and geographical distribution of this campaign. 

5

2. Analysis
During the spring of 2014, Kaspersky Lab was involved in a forensic analysis 
of ATMs dispensing cash to people located near them but with no physical 
interaction according to security cameras. No malware was detected on these 
ATMs. However, Carberp-like malware was found on a computer that was 
connected to them via VPN. 
Following the investigation of this incident, in the summer of 2014, Kaspersky 
Lab identified the same Carberp-like malware in another investigation involving 
a bank, where criminals were able to gain access to its online banking systems. 
In this investigation, we started analyzing all the computers in the bank’s 
infrastructure in order to find the source of the infection. We found spear phishing 
emails with CPL files attached that, after a successful infection, install the same 
Carberp-like malware we had previously found in the case involving the ATMs. 
There is evidence indicating that in most cases the network was compromised 
for between two to four months, and that many hundreds of computers within a 
single victim organization may have been infected. This period of time was used 
by the attackers to get access to the right victims and critical systems, and to 
learn how to operate their tools and systems to get the cash out.
Carbanak contains an espionage component that allows the attackers to take 
control of video capabilities on the victim systems. Thanks to this, long term 
observation and reconnaissance could be conducted. This allowed the attackers 
to understand the protocols and daily operational tempo of their targets. Based 
on this understanding, exploitation methodologies and mechanisms were 
developed and tailored to each victim.

2.1 Infection and Transmission
All observed cases used spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003 
(.doc) files attached or CPL files. The doc files exploit both Microsoft Office (CVE-
2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE- 2014-1761).
There are indicators that point to a possible Chinese origin for the exploits used 
in these attachments. Command and Control (C2) servers located in China have 
been identified in this campaign. In addition, registration information for some of 
the domains use details of supposedly Chinese citizens. Obviously, all this could 
just be a red herring.

6

The targets were all employees affiliated to the affected institution. The spear 
phishing email messages appeared legitimate and in some cases were sent from 
compromised coworkers´ accounts. In this way compromised systems were used 
as a transmission vector.
Given that the victims were mostly Russian-speaking financial institutions, 
the names of the attachments we have identified were generally in Russian. 
Examples include “Соответствие ФЗ-115” and “Приглашение” which translate 
into “Accordance to Federal Law” and “Invitation” respectively. This is enough to 
induce a typical employee to open the attachment and execute the malware. For 
a complete list of file names see Appendix 4.
The following is an example of a Carbanak spear phishing email:

Translated:

In this case, the attachment was a CPL file compressed using the Roshal Archive 
(.rar) format.
Once the remote code execution vulnerability is successfully exploited, it installs 
Carbanak on the victim's system. The complete list of observed spear phishing 
emails can be found in Appendix 1 – Spear phishing.
An additional infection vector that we believe was used by the criminals is 
a classical drive-by-download attack. We have found traces of the Null and 
the RedKit exploits kits.

2.2 Malware Analysis – Backdoor.Win32.Carbanak
Carbanak is a backdoor used by the attackers to compromise the victim's machine 
once the exploit, either in the spear phishing email or exploit kit, successfully 
executes its payload. This section provides a functional analysis of Carbanak’s 
capabilities.
Carbanak copies itself into “%system32%\com” with the name “svchost.exe” with 
the file attributes: system, hidden and read-only. The original file created by the 
exploit payload is then deleted.
To ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new 
service. The naming syntax is “<ServiceName>Sys” where ServiceName is any 
existing service randomly chosen, with the first character deleted. For example, 
if the existing service´s name is “aspnet” and the visible name is “Asp.net state 

8

service”, the service created by the malware would be “aspnetSys” with a visible 
name of “Sp.net state service”.
Before creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe 
or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. 
If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability 
in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, 
Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local 
privilege escalation. We believe this is not relevant and that the attackers adapt 
their tools to the victim´s defenses. 
Carbanak creates a file with a random name and a .bin extension in 
%COMMON_APPDATA%\Mozilla where it stores commands to be executed. 
Then the malware gets the proxy configuration from the registry entry:
[HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
and the Mozilla Firefox configuration file in:
%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\<ProfileName>\prefs.js

How to detect Carbanak
One of the best methods for detecting Carbanak is to look for .bin files in the 
folder:
..\All users\%AppData%\Mozilla\
The malware saves files in this location that will later be sent to the C2 server 
when an internet connection is detected.
A .BAT script for detecting infections is provided in the Appendixes.

Additionally, Carbanak can obtain proxy configuration information from headers 
sent through an application via SOCKS or HTTP.
Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe. Most of the actions described below 
happen within this process.
Carbanak downloads the file kldconfig.plug from its C2 server. This file includes 
the names of the processes to be monitored.
Once the system is infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots 
every 20 seconds. This monitoring is performed by intercepting the 
ResumeThread call.

9

To enable connections to the infected computer using the Remote Desktop 
Protocol (RDP), Carbanak sets Termservice service execution mode to Auto. Also, 
after executing this service, it modifies the executable code in memory in order to 
establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users. Modules 
modified in this process are: termsrv.dll, csrsrv.dll, msgina.dll and winlogon.exe.
If Carbanak detects the banking application BLIZKO (funds transfer software) in 
the infected computer, it sends a special notification to its C2 server. Carbanak 
is also aware of the IFOBS banking application and can, on command, substitute 
the details of payment documents in the IFOBS system.
To communicate with its C2 server, Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with 
RC2+Base64 encryption, adding additional characters not included in Base64. 
It also inserts strings with different extensions (.gif,.htm, etc.) at random locations 
in the HTTP request.
Example of a typical Carbanak request:

Carbanak sends its collected monitoring data to its C2 server. It also receives 
commands. The commands are compared with a hash table; if there is a match 
Carbanak performs the associated action:

Geographical Distribution
Known samples of Carbanak have been uploaded to VirusTotal from the following 
locations:

Figure 5. Countries from which Carbanak has been uploaded

 

Known exploits that download Carbanak have been uploaded to VirusTotal mostly 
from Russia. 

According to KSN data, victims are distributed geographically as follows:

The analyzed Carbanak samples, excluding some obvious outliers, have 
the following compilation time distribution:

It is also very interesting to see the distribution of Carbanak submissions to 
VirusTotal. This way we can identify periods when the malware came to the 
attention of potential victims and security researchers, and helps to reveal 
peaks in the group’s activity:

Since the beginning of this case, Kaspersky Lab has worked in cooperation with 
the LEAs investigating it. During the investigation LEAs shared with us statistical 
data from their research that helped us to complete our picture of the campaign. 

The following map shows targets’ IP addresses found in three of Carbanak’s 
Linux servers at the end of October 2014:

2.3 Lateral movement tools
Carbanak uses different tools on infected systems, each one with a different 
purpose. There appears to be a preference for the Ammyy Admin remote 
administration tool for remote control. Specifically, the attackers have been 
detected uploading:

Ammyy Admin 3.5 (f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec) as svchost.exe

It is believed that the attackers used this remote administration tool because 
it is commonly whitelisted in the victims’ environments as a result of being 
used regularly by administrators. 
In another instance, a Secure Shell (SSH) backdoor was used to communicate 
with the C2 server in 190.97.165.126 (operatemesscont.net).
This indicates that the attackers did not limit themselves to Microsoft Windows 
environments. In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to 
connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine’s SSH daemon 
with a backdoor so they could gain direct access.
Logs for these tools indicate that they were accessed from two different IPs, 
probably used by the attackers, and located in Ukraine and France.
We have also found traces of many different tools used by the attackers inside 
the victim´s network to gain control of additional systems, such as Metasploit, 
PsExec or Mimikatz.

19

2.4 Command and Control (C2) Servers
There appear to be four distinct types of C2 servers:
•	 Linux servers used for issuing commands to deployed Carbanak instances 

and for receiving collected monitoring data;

•	 Windows servers used for remote connections to victim systems;
•	 Backup servers; and
•	 Drop servers where additional executable files (e.g. remote administration 

tools) are hosted.

Server rotation occurs more or less on a biweekly basis. For a complete list of 
identified Carbanak servers please check the regularly updated Carbanak IOC 
document. The current list of IOCs is provided at Appendix 3 in his document.
Some of these C2 servers are responsible for dropping Ammyy (configuration 
and executable files), the KLG plugin configuration (list of processes to monitor) 
and the VNC server (both 32 and 64 bits to be injected in rundll). In one of the 
observed servers there was also a Metasploit module.

Victim systems are catalogued in the servers’ databases. The victims belong 
to a number of different communities, thus simplifying administration. In all, 
85 different victims belonging to seven communities were found.

 

 

21

Attacker´s operational details
Additionally, the malicious servers contain video files that capture a victim´s 
activity. While the videos are stored using a compressed format which provides 
poor image quality, the selected format minimizes upload bandwith and is of 
sufficient quality for the attackers to understand the victims’ activities.
The video file naming conventions used the name of the application in the 
foreground (e.g., Outlook, Cmd, etc.) and only recorded user activity. This helped 
the attackers to both navigate to files of interest and to discard superfluous files.

Figure 14. Special video player designed to watch Carbanak´s video stream

 

Using the intelligence gained from video and other monitoring techniques, the 
attackers developed an operational picture of the victim's workflow, tooling and 
practices. This picture helps the attackers to deploy their malicious operations, 
for example:
•	 Attackers created fake transactions in the victim’s internal database after 
the verification process, thus avoiding discovery of the fraudulent activity; 
•	 Attackers used the victim’s internal command utilities to insert fraudulent 

operations in the transaction queue.

In general, the attackers demonstrated great versatility, using attack 
methodologies best suited to a specific victim’s operational methodology. 
However, they seemed to deliberately limit the amount of money stolen per 
victim to $10 million USD. This limit may be explained as the maximum amount 

22

of money that can be transferred via mule services, or the maximum amount of 
money that is budgeted in banks for fraud risks in order to minimize the chances 
of LEAs and the bank´s anti-fraud teams from doing a full blown analysis. 

Figure 15. List of PIN KVC used on ATMs

 

Sensitive bank documents have be found on the servers that were controlling 
Carbanak. They included classified emails, manuals, crypto keys, passwords 
and so on. For example, the file in the above figure has KVC (key verification codes) 
keys that are used by ATMs to check the integrity of the PIN numbers of its users. 
In other cases involving ATMs, the criminals were able to control computers that 
had access to the internal ATM network. If the bank had enabled remote access 
to ATMs, the criminals started using this access to remotely withdraw cash. 
Criminals used no malware to operate the ATM dispenser; instead they used 
standard utilities to control and test ATM equipment. 

23

3. Conclusions
Malware targeting the finance industry (both companies and consumers) 
continues to evolve. The Carbanak malware used in the on-going campaign 
described in this report has been very successful in terms of generating 
revenue. Of particular interest are the attack methods, similar to those used 
in sophisticated cyber-espionage APTs. As such, they represent a new and 
disturbing trend in the cybercrime market of increasing attack sophistication.
Despite increased awareness of cybercrime within the financial services sector, 
it appears that spear phishing attacks and old exploits (for which patches have 
been disseminated) remain effective against larger companies. Attackers always 
use this minimal effort approach in order to bypass a victim´s defenses.
Advanced control and fraud detection systems have been used for years by the 
financial services industry. However, these focus on fraudulent transactions within 
customer accounts. The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections, by for 
example, using the industry-wide funds transfer (the SWIFT network), updating 
balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms (the ATM network). 
In neither of these cases did the attackers exploit a vulnerability within the 
service. Instead, they studied the victim´s internal procedures and pinpointed 
who they should impersonate locally in order to process fraudulent transactions 
through the aforementioned services.
It is clear that the attackers were very familiar with financial services software 
and networks. As part of an automated reconnaissance phase, the Carbanak 
malware checked victim systems for the presence of specialized and specific 
banking software. Only after the presence of banking systems was confirmed, 
were victims further exploited. To date, attacks against approximately 300 IP 
addresses around the world have been observed on analyzed C2s. It is possible 
that these attacks were coordinated to maximize returns prior to industry-wide 
information sharing and the implementation of countermeasures.
Existing telemetry indicates that the Carbanak attackers are trying to expand 
operations to other Baltic and Central Europe countries, the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa. Carbanak may be responsible for losses as high as $1 billion USD. 
We believe that the Carbanak campaign is a clear indicator of a new era in 
cybercrime in which criminals use APT techniques directly against the financial 
industry instead of through its customers. APTs are not only for stealing 
information anymore.
