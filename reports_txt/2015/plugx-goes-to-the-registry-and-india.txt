PlugX goes to the registry (and India)

Overview
Recently we published a paper about the capabilities of APT groups [https://nakedsecurity.
sophos.com/2015/02/03/exploit-this-evaluating-the-exploit-skills-of-malware-groups/]. 

One of the conclusions of the paper was that the authors behind the targeted attack campaigns 
usually have little knowledge about the actual exploit they are using to distribute their malware. 
But at the same time, we warned our readers never to underestimate them, because otherwise 
they are skilled, and quite capable of developing sophisticated backdoors.

One of the worst performances in our comparison of exploit development belonged to the 
infamous PlugX malware group(s). However, they recently came out with a couple of significant 
developments in the backdoor component, demonstrating the point above.

One of the improvements was the introduction of a peer-to-peer communication channel to other 
infected hosts [http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2015/01/analysis-of-a-r-ff05.html]. Variants using this 
technology have previously been spotted in the Rotten Tomato campaign [http://blogs.sophos.
com/2014/10/30/the-rotten-tomato-campaign-new-sophoslabs-research-on-apts/]. 

Now additional samples have shown up from this generation. But in addition to the new 
communication method, some of them were showing another new characteristic: the payload 
was not stored as separate files, or embedded within the loader DLL, but instead was saved to 
the registry.

Malware hiding components in registry is not a revolutionary idea; we have seen that before. 
Most notably the recent Poweliks Trojan [https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/poweliks-
the-persistent-malware-without-a-file.html] stored the active script component in the registry. 
Even some of the APT malware families, like Poison or Frethog, occasionally used the registry as 
storage for the main payload. 

There were precursors even within the criminal groups distributing PlugX: they used this method 
back in 2013 in a couple of cases for storing the Omdork (a.k.a. Sybin) payload. So it was only a 
question of when the same would happen to the main PlugX backdoor. And that time arrived this 
January.

PlugX in registry
The new variants were distributed using two distinguishable classes of exploited carrier 
documents – though in both cases the CVE-2012-0158 exploit was used.

For the first type the distribution was part of a longer campaign, targeting India. This campaign 
spanned several months, from September 2014 to February 2015. During this time span 
different variants of the PlugX backdoor were observed as the final payload. Apparently, this was 
an ongoing operation, where the actors behind it used the latest available versions, as they came 
out of the factory. Additionally, a few affiliated malware families were distributed to the targets.

The samples of the second type showed up the first week of February. At this point we don’t have 
conclusive information about the scope and target of the campaign that used these samples.

The payload is stored in encrypted form in the registry. It is loaded, decrypted and executed 
by the malware loader component. That loader is very similar to the usual PlugX loader DLLs, 
except that it loads the payload from a registry key instead of a separate file.

PlugX payload in the registry

The stored payload is the new P2P PlugX backdoor, with internal function names not seen in 
earlier PlugX v2 versions: ZX, ZXWT, JP1, JP2, JP3, JP4, JP5, JAP0, JAP1.

PlugX backdoors use a specific date parameter at specific places in the code. This constant 
could be used as a major version identifier: when the backdoor code was only slightly modified, 
the constant did not change. When the constant was updated, that usually meant a significant 
change in the code. 

In earlier versions this constant was a meaningful date in hexadecimal representation (e.g. 
0x20130810 in most of the next generation PlugX samples). In the P2P PlugX version it changed, 
now being a meaningful date in decimal representation (e.g. 0x13352AF = 20140719 in the case 
of the Rotten Tomato samples).

In the case of registry stored PlugX variants, this constant was stepped further to 20150108, 
which indicates a new development from the factory. Less than a month later these new variants 
were already spotted in targeted campaigns in India.

Peeled Tomato
The first campaign we labelled as Peeled Tomato, in reference to the earlier Rotten Tomato case, 
because they were clearly derived from those samples.

As a reminder, the original structure of the Rotten Tomato samples was the following:

Encrypted Zbot

CVE-2012-0158 exploit 

and shellcode

CVE-2014-1761 exploit 
and first stage shellcode

Memory marker and 

CVE-2014-1761 second 

stage shellcode

Encrypted PlugX

The RTF documents started with an encrypted Zbot Trojan (remainder of the original template 
used for creating the samples), then a block using the CVE-2012-0158 exploit and the 
corresponding shellcode. After that, there was a block using the CVE-2014-1761 exploit and the 
corresponding first stage shellcode, followed by the second stage shellcode from the CVE-2014-
1761 exploit, and finally the encrypted PlugX backdoor.

The first stage of the CVE-2014-1761 shellcode used a bad offset for the second stage code, 
thus this exploit never worked.

PlugX goes to the registry (and India)

Having realized the failure of the attempt, the malware authors removed the CVE-2014-1761 
exploit block. But even that was not done completely. As a result, they ended up with documents 
showing the following structure:

Encrypted Zbot

CVE-2012-0158 exploit 

and shellcode

Memory marker and 

CVE-2014-1761 second 

stage shellcode

Encrypted PlugX

Samples
Not surprisingly, just like with several other campaigns, in this case it was observed that different 
malware families were distributed using similar carrier documents; only the encrypted payload 
was replaced at the end of the file. The shellcode used in the carrier was very convenient for 
this purpose: the length and location of the final payload was stored at the end of the file. It was 
possible to swap the payload without needing to modify the exploit condition and the shellcode 
itself. And this is exactly what the malware authors did.

This sample is an outlier, as it was distributed in January 2015, and in Russia. The decoy 
document is also unconvential, of minimalistic design.

But the carrier document and the C&C server name shows correlation with the rest of the

Multi-staged installer shellcode
This second batch of exploited documents had a different structure. All start with a heading RTF 
content (which is exactly the same in all of the documents), followed by the block that exploits 
the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, along with the first stage shellcode, followed by the second 
and third stage shellcodes, and finally the encrypted payload executable.

RTF heading of exploited documents

The shellcode itself is encrypted with a 4 byte XOR algorithm, with a lot of inserted junk 
instructions:

edi, ebx 
short loc_13B 

[edi], esi 
short loc_14B

The underlying shellcode is multi-stage andhas already been observed in an earlier sample 
dropping a PlugX v2 variant (SHA1: 9b90d6608ba6167619b5991fd70319dfcd1fa881, date 
constant 0x20140613), but in that case without the top level cryptor.

After the initial bootstrap code is decrypted, it identifies the carrier by looking for ‘DCBA’ at file 
offset 0x4e28. If it is found there, it allocates a memory area and decrypts (using one byte XOR 
algorithm) the next stage starting from right after the ID string.

The second stage code decrypts and drops two files: the self-extracting installer archive M.B 
and the first stage installer M.T into the %TEMP% folder, then allocates another memory region, 
decrypts, copies and executes the third stage shellcode there. 

The third stage shellcode copies the first stage installer (which is a DLL library) M.T into 
%WINDOWS%\Tasks\n.dll, then executes by calling LoadLibrary to load it. The Windows loader 
upon loading the DLL will execute its entry code. This entry code runs the self-extracting 
installer archive M.B which will do the final malware installation in the system. This final piece of 
installation process is malware family dependent.

This new shellcode also indicates some heavy development in the PlugX factory. Both this kind 
of multi-stage shellcode and the external cryptor indicate that although the group is not top 
class in exploit development, in conventional malware development they show serious skills, 
which makes them dangerous.

This sample is an outlier. It does not distribute PlugX, but uses a strikingly similar persistence 
method, with exactly the same file names that are used with PlugX installations. Only the final 
payload is a different backdoor, Omdork, which has earlier been observed in PlugX related 
distribution channels.

dll.

The persistence is achieved by two methods: RasTls.exe is registered in HKCU\Software\
Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run → msusr, and the n.dll is dropped to the Windows Tasks 
directory for  automatic execution.

While the file names are the same as in the case of many PlugX deployments, the files 
themselves are very different. 

RasTls.exe is not digitally signed, it is the loader Trojan, that loads the encrypted payload from 
a resource. This payload itself contains a loader code, and an embedded executable, that is the 
final payload.

The n.dll file executes a backup installer, M.B, which is dropped into the %TEMP% directory. This 
installer is a self-extracting WinRAR that contains RasTls.exe and a config file.

There are still reasons to believe that this malware is strongly connected to the PlugX group:

 Ì It uses the same filenames as some of the PlugX deployments
