Introduction

Highly targeted attacks refer to a category of  threats that pertain to intrusions by threat actors 
or attackers. These attackers aggressively pursue and compromise chosen targets in order to 
steal  sensitive  information.  These  are  not  conducted  through  separate  attacks;  rather,  they 
comprise of  a series of  attempts over time to get deeper and deeper into a target’s network. 
Each attempt may either succeed or fail, but the overall goal is to penetrate the target’s network 
and  acquire  information.  Malware  is  typically  used  as  an  attack  vector,  but  the  real  threat 
involves human operators who adapt, adjust, and improve their methods based on the victim’s 
defenses.

Enterprises should consider targeted attacks a high-priority threat because of  the considerable 
damage they incur. The human and systemic weaknesses that allow an attacker to compromise 
an organization can be minimized and mitigated with correct practices and solutions. However, 
these same weaknesses can never be fully resolved.

Trend Micro monitors the targeted attack landscape in order to identify ongoing campaigns and 
provide additional threat intelligence useful for identifying the existence of  these campaigns 
in  an  enterprise  network.  This  quarterly  report  presents  the  targeted  attack  campaigns 
observed and mitigated by Trend Micro based on reported customer cases, as well as our own 
independently gathered data.

Campaigns Observed in 2Q

Targeted Attack Campaigns Profiling 

We encountered a variety of  targeted campaigns in the second quarter of  the year. 
These include the following:

•  IXESHE.  The  IXESHE  campaign  is  known  for  targeting  East  Asian 
governments,  electronics  manufacturers,  and  telecommunications  firms.  We 
released a white paper discussing this campaign.1 IXESHE has been active since 
2012.

•  ELISE. This recently discovered campaign also targets government agencies 
in  the  Asia  Pacific  region.  It  is  called  ELISE  after  certain  strings  found 
in  its  unpacked  code.  (We  detect  the  malware  used  by  this  campaign  as  
BKDR_ELISE.)

•  ZEGOST. This family of  backdoors (aka HTTP Tunnel) is Chinese in origin 

and was used in attacks against Asian government organizations.

•  BEEBUS/MUTTER. This is a targeted campaign believed to be associated 
with  the  Comment  Crew  attacker  group  because  of   the  use  of   encrypted/
obfuscated HTML comments to hide their C&C transactions.

•  TravNet. This campaign made use of  a malware family identified as NetTraveler 
based on the strings found in the malware code. The malware is detected as  
BKDR_TRAVLAR.

Affected Industry Sectors

Our data indicates that the majority of  targeted attack victims are various government 
agencies. Targeted firms from the technology sector include telecommunication firms, 
Internet service providers, and software companies. The financial services sector and 
the aerospace industry were also targeted this quarter.

Targeted attacks discovered by industry

Affected Regions

The targeted attacks that we analyzed were heavily concentrated in Asia, particularly 
Taiwan and Japan.

Targeted attacks discovered by region

Attachments Used In Targeted Attacks

Based on our findings, the most common type of  email attachment type used in targeted 
attacks were file archives of  various forms. When uncompressed, these archives typically 
contain the malicious payload itself, which the user may then run directly. Alternately, 
they may also contain a .DOC file that contains exploit code. RTF files made up the 
second most common file type.

File types used in targeted attacks

Frequently, the .EXE files we see are made to appear as ordinary documents or folders 
using appropriately chosen icons. In addition, we also saw an increased use of  files that 
make use of  right-to-left override (RTLO) in Unicode. 

C&C Statistics

We were also able to monitor the activity of  various C&C servers related to targeted 
attacks. By volume of  C&C server activity, the following countries ranked as follows:

Feature: EvilGrab Campaign Targets Diplomatic Agencies

In this report, we will provide a detailed analysis of  the EvilGrab campaign. This campaign 
was first found targeting certain Asian and European governments. Its name is derived from 
its behavior of  grabbing audio, video, and screenshots from affected machines.

Currently, the malware used by EvilGrab belongs to one of  three malware families:

•  BKDR_HGDER

•  BKDR_EVILOGE

•  BKDR_NVICM

Targets

Our research indicates that EvilGrab activity is most prevalent in China and Japan, 
although it is also present in other parts of  the world. Government organizations were, 
by far, the most affected by EvilGrab. This geolocation is based on the IP addresses of  
the victims. Therefore, foreign institutions within China would be identified as coming 
from China; the same would hold true for all countries. EvilGrab was also found in the 
United States, Canada, France, Spain, and Australia, among others.

Attack Vectors

Research indicates that EvilGrab is primarily distributed through spear-phishing emails 
with malicious attachments that exploit various vulnerabilities to run malicious code. 
Among the attachment types are:

•  Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheets (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2012-2543)

•  PDFs (CVE-2013-0640)

•  Microsoft® Word® documents (CVE-2012-0158) 

A .RAR file with a folder named thumbs.db was also seen containing malicious code. 
By  using  this  name,  the  intention  was  to  disguise  itself   as  the  Windows  thumbnail 
cache. A shortcut file (.LNK) was also seen in the .RAR file, which used a folder icon 
to make users believe it was another folder. In reality, running the .LNK file executes 
the malware. In addition, the .RAR file contains a desktop.ini file in order to change the 
thumbs.db folder icon into the icon of  the Windows thumbnail cache.

Exploits, Payloads, and Decoy Documents

The EvilGrab campaign’s use of  exploits, payloads, and decoy documents is similar to 
the Taidoor campaign in 2012.2 The primary difference is that EvilGrab variants have 
multiple layers of  shellcode. In addition, some variants copy the file name and use it as 
the decoy document file name. Other variants overwrite the exploit document with the 
contents of  the decoy document.

As noted above, some variants also use disguised folders and shortcuts and do not use 
exploits to run their code.

DLL Preloading Using the Windows Shell and Fax Server

DLL preloading is a vulnerability that has been documented for over three years.3 The 
EvilGrab campaign makes use of this vulnerability for its AutoRun routine.

Whenever it is run, the Windows shell (explorer.exe) loads a component of  the fax server 
in  Windows,  fxsst.dll.  This  is  normally  located  in  the  System32  folder.  Whenever  an 
instance of  explorer.exe is launched (i.e., at every system startup), the system searches for 
the said .DLL file and loads it.

EvilGrab drops one of  its .DLL components in the Windows folder, where explorer.
exe is also located. The malicious .DLL (also named fxsst.dll) is loaded instead of  the 
legitimate copy. It also serves as the loader of  the main backdoor.

9

While DLL preloading has been used by other malware in the past, it is less common 
to see it specifically target explorer.exe. Other malware families that use this vulnerability 
typically target executable files outside of  Windows; EvilGrab targets a part of  Windows 
itself.

Other Autorun Behaviors

In addition to the above behavior, EvilGrab also creates the following registry entry to 
enable its automatic execution at every system startup:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
UKey = “%Application Data%\360\Live360.exe”

The  file  %Application  Data%\360\Live360.exe  is  a  copy  of   one  of   the  malware 
components. It also creates a shortcut under the Startup folder in the Start menu:

• 

IEChecker.lnk

•  Target: “%UserProfile%\IEChecker.exe” –L

• 

Icon: %Full path of  Iexplorer.exe% (This uses the Internet Explorer icon 
and disguise itself as part of  Internet Explorer.)

The above file is also a copy of one of  the malicious components.

Stealth Operation

EvilGrab has three primary components: one .EXE file and two .DLL files. The .EXE 
file acts as the installer for all of  the EvilGrab components. One of  the .DLL files 
serves as a loader for the other .DLL file, which is the main backdoor component. 
Some variants of  EvilGrab delete the .EXE file after installation to cover its tracks more 
effectively. As noted earlier, the loader file is named fxsst.dll. However, examination of  
its header states that its actual file name is supposed to be svchost.dll.

These components are also encrypted and saved in the registry. To add stealth to its 
backdoor routines, it uses a legitimate process context’s memory space to inject the 
main backdoor.

10

By default, this backdoor injects itself  into the svchost.exe or winlogon.exe process. It also 
checks  if   certain  processes  related  to  certain  security  products  are  running  on  the 
affected system. The specific processes targeted are:

•  avp.exe

•  klwtblfs.exe

• 

starter.exe

•  wmifw.exe

Other variants of  this malware also check if  other security products are present. It is 
not clear why EvilGrab specifically targets these products. However, it is possible that 
the attackers determined that targets for this campaign are likely running these products.

Registry Storage

EvilGrab stores its components in the following registry entries:

HKCU\Software\rar and/or HKLM\SOFTWARE\rar
data = {Encrypted copy of the main backdoor DLL}
s = {Encrypted copy of the loader DLL}
e = {Encrypted string which points to the full path of  

the installer EXE}

 

 

Media Grabbing

To capture video, EvilGrab creates a capture window with the class name of  ESET. 
It uses the Sample Grabber filter (part of  the DirectShow technology in Windows) to 
directly perform grabbing.4 It also uses Wave APIs to capture audio.5

User Credential Theft

EvilGrab steals user credentials related to the following applications and/or protocols:

•  HTTP 

•  HTTPMail 

• 

• 

IMAP 

Internet Explorer (IE)

•  Microsoft Outlook 

11

•  MSN

•  POP3 

•  Protected Storage 

•  SMTP 

•  Windows Messaging

EvilGrab steals these credentials by parsing the following registry keys: 

	

 

	

 

Windows	Messaging	Subsystem\Profiles

• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ 
•	HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows	Messaging	Subsystem\Profiles
• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Account Manager\Accounts
•	HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\ 

OMI Account Manager\Accounts

It queries the above keys for related values that correspond to the applications and 
protocols listed earlier. The values are then decrypted using the system library pstorec.dll.

It also steals login credential from IE autocomplete entries. It does this by first parsing 
the index.dat files in the IE History folder. It then collects autocomplete entries from 
the following registry key:

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2

It then initiates a brute force attack on encrypted credentials using the CryptUnprotectData 
API. However, it will only try to steal passwords from IE’s password-protected sites 
and MSN Explorer Signup if  kav.exe (related to a security product) is not running in the 
system.

12

Tencent QQ Memory Reading

If  the active window is Tencent QQ (specifically, QQ2009 through QQ2012), EvilGrab 
will attempt to steal information by directly reading the process’s memory and checking 
if  the class name of  the focused window is not named “EDIT.”

The contents of  the process’s memory are then saved onto the system’s hard drive as 
%UserProfile%\users.bin. It is then sent back to the backdoor’s C&C server. The file on 
the hard drive is encrypted; specifically, the data is XORed with the key 0x66.

Key Logging

EvilGrab also possesses keylogging capabilities. The logged keystrokes are then sent 
back to the C&C and saved to %User Profile%\users.bin. The file on the hard drive is 
encrypted; specifically, the data is XORed with the key 0x66.

13

Command & Control Servers

Each backdoor has one to three C&C servers in its code. Some of  C&C servers that we 
have seen from our accumulated data are as follows:

•  112.121.182.150

•  113.10.246.46

•  113.10.190.55

•  202.130.112.231

•  micoosofts.com

•  qtds1979 .3322. org

•  qtds1979.gicp.net

14

Backdoor Activity

To  start  its  connection  to  its  C&C  server,  the  backdoor  component  will  first  send 
5-bytes (\x01\x00\x00\x00\x33). The C&C will reply if  it accepts the connection. 
The backdoor then replies with a beacon message, the contents of  which are as follows:

Description

Process ID of the process where the 
backdoor is injected

<%d> = 21C (540.)

Hardcoded 0x00

<%d> = 0

15

Either  backdoor  identifier  1  or  backdoor  identifier  2  acts  as  the  campaign  code  or 
marker  for  EvilGrab  campaigns,  which  is  recognizable  by  the  C&C  server  and/or 
attacker. Some of  the identifiers we saw in backdoor identifier 1 are:

•  006

•  007

•  0401

•  072002

•  3k-Ja-0606

•  3k-jp01

•  4k-lyt25

•  88j

•  e-0924

•  LJ0626

•  RB0318

Some of  the identifiers seen in our accumulated data in backdoor identifier 2 are as 
follows:

•  V2010-v16

•  V2010-v24

We noted a correlation between the MZ/PE headers of  variants and the strings in 
backdoor  identifier  2.  Variants  with  a  V2010-v24  identifier  have  a  proper  MZ/PE 
header; variants with a V2010-v16 header have portions of  their header overwritten with 
JPEG strings. These variants require a loader component to load them into memory in 
order to be executed.

These  capabilities  can  be  used  for  both  lateral  movement  within  a  compromised 
organization and to steal information. EvilGrab steals internal user names and passwords 
as well as logs keystrokes. Credentials stolen this way can be used to move within the 
confines of  the organization’s network. 

EvilGrab possesses a wide variety of  information theft capabilities. It can grab audio 
and  video  files  directly  from  devices  attached  on  the  system  (i.e.  microphone  and 
camera). In addition, EvilGrab can upload files from the affected system to remote 
servers. EvilGrab possesses a full range of  capabilities that is expected in malware used 
in targeted attacks against organizations.

20

Trend Micro Recommendations

Targeted attacks pose a challenge to traditional signature-based security solutions. To deal with 
these type of  threats, employ solutions that include network monitoring to detect and analyze 
incoming threats, as well as any outgoing communication with attacking parties.

Products like Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ are capable of  mitigating the risks from these 
threats. One component of  Deep Discovery, the Deep Discovery Inspector, provides network 
threat detection, custom sandboxing, and real-time analysis and reporting. 

The second component, Deep Discovery Advisor, provides sandbox analysis of  known and 
unknown threats that augments the capabilities of  existing products like endpoint solution and 
email/web gateways. It also provides visibility to network-wide security events.

The capabilities provided by solutions like Deep Discovery are necessary to provide a unified, 
comprehensive view of  the threats an organization faces. This information can then be used 
by an organization to create appropriate and proportional responses to properly protect an 
organization’s network.
