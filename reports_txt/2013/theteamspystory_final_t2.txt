in Cyberespionage Campaigns 

Kaspersky Lab Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT)  

Version 1.02 - 20 March 2013 

Introduction 

For at least several years, a mysterious threat actor infiltrated and tracked, performed surveillance and stole data from 
governmental organisations, some private companies and human rights activists throughout the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) and Eastern European nations. Some parts of this operation extended into Western nations and the 
Middle East as well, with victims in sectors such as energy and heavy industry manufacturing. The attackers performed their 
intelligence gathering and surveillance partly using TeamViewer (http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx), a legitimate 
support software package commonly used for remote administration. In addition, they deployed custom written intelligence 
gathering components and lateral movement utilities.  

We are calling this threat actor the “TeamSpy crew” because of their preference for using the legal software TeamViewer as a 
main part of their toolset. 

So, Team What? 

TeamSpy. This covert cross-nation, cyber surveillance data theft and monitoring operation may not have recruited technical 
wizards for their team. But the use of legitimate, signed software packages in addition to custom made software, along with 
various dll path hijack tricks, allowed the threat actor to conduct effective operations targeting hundreds of victims, including 
high level/high value individuals.  

According to its web site, TeamViewer is a “All-In-One Software for Remote Support and Online Meetings”. It is “free for 
private use” and is installed by “more than 100,000,000 users spread over more than 200 countries”. TeamViewer has versions 
available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iPhone or Android, making it a very flexible remote administration tool.

The TeamViewer web site 

 

Compared to Poison Ivy and other Remote Access Tools (RATs) that have been in the news for years, TeamViewer has an 
advantage which makes it attractive to cybercriminals: is comes signed, adding to its seeming legitimacy. 

 

 

 

In addition to TeamViewer, the TeamSpy operations are supplemented by a variety of custom-built surveillance modules. 
Instead of maintaining all operations with the TeamViewer RAT, the team developed their own reconnaissance and stealth 
modules. These provide TeamSpy attackers with the following functionality:

Extend TeamViewer remote control functionality to ensure stealth and persistence, 
self defense from automated and manual analysis and discovery, maintain 
communications and updates with attackers’ command-and-control 

One interesting “fingerprint” of this operation is the inclusion of custom, hand-drawn icons in some of the attack tools. 
Examples include: 

 

It seems that at least at heart, one of the TeamSpy crew members dreams of being a graphic artist. Or maybe they tried to 
send security researchers a hidden message? 

Observations about the TeamSpy Toolset - “No find glue file!” 

The toolset demonstrates clever, although lazy choices about legitimate software and certificate abuse, along with a minimal 
but effective effort at using simple and crude custom encryption algorithms.  

We’ve analyzed in depth two command and control servers used by the attackers but we are aware of several others used in 
the campaign. The two servers we analyzed are “politnews.org” and “bannetwork.org”.

On the command and control servers, the attackers maintain tools and modules, some obfuscated and named as JPG files. The 
“.JPG” files maintain hidden executable codes, and are simply encoded with a rolling XOR encryption using the same key across 
all of the components: “0x0e0f101112”.  

There are quite a few traces left by the attackers, which normally can give you hints about attaсkers’ profile. 

For example, a keylogger tool used a system event called "__klgskot__". While "klg" stands for keylogger, "skot" is a Russian 
word meaning "livestock".  

There are many more Russian language traces in this malware toolkit. The version of Teamviewer server which is used as a 
part of malware bundle is Russian localized. It at least includes TeamViewer_Resource_ru.dll file which has a set of Russian 
strings used by the application. 

A couple of other modules, while searching for files on the hard drive, looked for those containing "pass", "secret", and 
Russian equivalents "парол" and "секрет". In addition to Russian, there was a Georgian equivalent of "secret", but written in 
the Latin alphabet: "saidumlo". 

In the recent Red October report, our research noted liberal use of Cyrillic characters throughout code and files...“Another 
noteworthy fact is in the first line of this file, which is a command to switch the codepage of an infected system to 1251. This is 
required to address files and directories that contain Cyrillic characters in their names”. Here is a screenshot demonstrating 
the system codepage switch in a malicious batch file: 

Usage of CP1251 in Red October 

 

Just like Red October, TeamSpy components maintain the same sort of language switch to Cyrillic throughout code and files. 
Here, we note that an entire TeamSpy SQLite database’s strings used to house stolen victim data, located on one of the major 
C2, is specified to default to the Cyrillic character set. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PAGE 4  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

Tables within the database are explicitly configured to use the Cyrillic character set. Here is the log table, filled with victim 
check-in records: 

The statistic table, along with all of the others, are explicitly Cyrillic: 

 

 

Also, some specifics come from C&C domain names, such as "bulbanews.org" and "kartopla.org". The words "bulba" and 
"kartopla" are written in Latin-Belarusian and Latin-Ukrainian, both words mean “a potato”. Interestingly, among ex-USSR 
countries, Belarusians are jokingly called "bulbashi" which means "potato people" due to the popularity of this vegetable in 
local agriculture. 

One of the modules we found, called footer has LANG_RUSSIAN property set in the resource section of the executable.  

Also, one of the database tables discovered at a C&C server contained some text in Russian written with latin alphabet: 

 

 

PAGE 5  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

 

A rough translation of the highlighted strings from Russian to English: 

"Obshie manevri. Ispolzovat' tolko s razreshenija S-a" = "General maneuvers. Use only after approval of S-a". 

"vkluchenie oomask" = "switching oomask on" 

"Ispolzovanie bilda ..." = "Using build ..." 

The same C&C we analyzed had a full FTP access log with source IP that uploaded malicious modules in 2012 (some of them 
were already removed from the server, but the names and sizes remained in the log file). This log file also shows intensive 
usage of Russian language in the file names: 

The filenames include "можно выдавать" which is translated as "ready to spread", "Проверка на прото" meaning "Protocol 
checks". The most amusing part of this log is "crypted_bulba" which is translated as "encrypted potato". Everyone is familiar 
with baked potato or mashed potato, however this is our first touch with "encrypted potato". 

The SystemInfoSave module lists all files in the “Program Files” folder which are newer than the hard-coded date: “22 
November 1963”. The date is clearly an “Easter Egg”, with several important incidents linked this specific date: 

 

●  US President John F. Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas. 
●  Aldous Huxley, the author of “Brave New World” and many other titles, dies. 
●  CS Lewis, the author of “Chronicles of Narnia” and many other titles, dies. 

 

Maintaining Teamwork and Infrastructure 

Our investigation of the team’s infrastructure centers around two domains used for command-and-control: “politnews.org” 
and “bannetwork.org”. But clearly, the strategy guiding this team is to pull off multiple “watering hole” attacks, and 
sometimes pollute ad networks, inefficiently blanketing the region they are most interested in with malvertizing and 
redirections to their malicious sites. These two servers have been heavily used over years of attack campaigns, with more 
recent servers receiving tens if not hundreds of hits in the past week.  

“politnews.org” was originally registered on the June 18th, 2004 by one “Zacepenko Ilia Igorevich” at OnlineNIC Inc: 

Zacepenko Ilia Igorevich 

9th square, 10-1,1 

NI Larne, GB 127591  

politnews@mail.ru 

 

 

PAGE 6  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

“bannetwork.org” was originally registered on September 2nd, 2004 by one “Dmitryi Ivastov” at OnlineNIC Inc as well: 

Dmitryi Ivastov 

Mira street, 1a 

Moscow, RU 103555 

bannetwork@mail.ru 

We believe that these are fictional identities and used only to register these individual domains.  

The two servers resided at several hosts over the past decade, but from 2010, both domains were maintained at Russian 
provider Host Telecom. (known malicious IP for “bannetwork.org”: “89.188.104.7”). 

For the most part, these systems maintain identical toolsets, structure, software and accounts. Both of these systems hosted 
an FTP server and an Apache HTTP web server, along with the same user accounts for running each. The HTTP servers were 
used to serve “job.txt”, which maintained a set of system commands for agents checking in, among other files described 
below. Interestingly, other files included “html” pages and exploits related to the well-known exploit kit “Eleonore Exploit 
Pack”, created and maintained by Exmanoize. 

Also, one of the server scripts to collect infection success statistics mentions the Eleonore exploit kit by name: 

 

And one of the more recent, current sites, “checkmeil.com”, is serving both malicious java and pdf files. Of course, just like 
Eleonore started serving couple of years ago, it defaults to deliver a malicious JAR file first, prior to other exploits potentially 
sent to the victim system. 

 

 

 

PAGE 7  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

 

The 2012 version of “door.jar” (CVE-2012-0507) exploit is blocked proactively by our AEP functionality at runtime and detected 
by Kaspersky products as “HEUR:Exploit.Java.CVE-2012-0507.gen". 
 

A malicious PDF is served if the Java Runtime is not present on the system. Our products detect this particular malicious file  as 
Exploit.JS.Pdfka.gbf. 

Most of the TeamSpy servers are using a free, Russian open source tool named “ReaderRssPhp 1.0”. This is a set of PHP scripts 
designed to “read and display RSS feeds on your site”. Most likely, the attackers planned their attacks well in advance and built 
a set of web sites using these scripts to provide news aggregation channels serving content at least somewhat relevant to their 
target victims’ favorite web sites.  

Over the past years, the attackers added exploit packs like Eleonore on their news aggregation sites. Then, the attackers 
injected iframes into carefully selected web sites frequently visited by their target victims. The iframes redirect these target 
visitors (and some extras) to their previously-prepared malicious sites. For instance, redirections from “konflikt.ru” to the 
attackers’ “bannetwork.org” started in October 2005. In February 2006, users were redirected from “daymohk.org” to 
“bannetwork.org”, followed by “www.turkmenistan.gov.tm” and “chechentimes.net” in March. The list of infected watering 
hole sites continued to grow from there.

Attacks from the “bannetwork.org” site appear to have been related to the following links by at least February 2010: 

bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/ 

bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/inc/function.php 

bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/ms-041.jpg 

bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/vx_2c.exe 

bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/new-ms-041.jpg 

Based on  the server access stats, we were able to put together a thorough list of web sites which appear to have acted as 
referrers to the exploit packs. Since the early infections, it appears that they have been compromised and redirecting visitors 
on and off until recently: 

daymohk.org 

chechenpress.info 

daymohk.chechenpress.org 

chechentimes.net 

caucasuslive.org 

kauna-talu.com.ua

Victim Checkins and Volume 

The command-and-control servers maintain a database of victims with their associated TeamViewer IDs and passwords. These 
can be seen in the C2 online interface which lists the IP, last access time and the user status: 

 

 

PAGE 9  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

The attacker can then connect to any of the online IPs using the known login/pass combination and silently spy on the victims.

For logging infections and handling infected users, all C2 servers rely on a MySQL database to which all the scripts connect. The 
username and password for the database connections are hardcoded in the C2 scripts, for instance: 

Several tables exist in the databases, named “stat_TV”, “stat_TV_log”, “stat”, “stat2”, “stat5058”, “statistic”. These carry 
various information about the victims that connected to the C2 as well as unique data that allows the attackers to interact 
with them. 

 

 
Lesser Used Spy Tools 

It seems that attackers outsourced much of their infiltration development work, utilizing exploit kits like Eleonore and others. 
It is the upfront investment of vulnerability research and exploit development and expertise that are beyond the reach of 
many interested parties like TeamSpy that results in this outsourcing. In addition to the commodity exploit packs, their sites 
are also known to spread the Ardamax keylogger, another cheap, commercially available surveillance package.

Statistics and Victim Profiles 

Kaspersky Security Network is Kaspersky’ cloud security services. It collects statistics on malware incidents from around the 
world. The TeamSpy attacks have been recorded in several countries around the world, with the highest number of incidents 
being in Russia and Ukraine. Here’s a map of infections: 

“Teamspy” KSN detections (unique PCs) - March 2013 

 

In addition to the KSN reports, we were able to extract a list of victims from two command and control servers’ databases. 
These are available to anyone who knows the URL which serves these lists.

In both cases, Russia and Turkey appear as top targets, with other countries such as India, Sweden, Iran or US following. 

It should be noted that the statistics from the command and control servers include only the victims that were infected with 
the Teamviewer-based package. The command servers have bigger logs which possibly include many other victims, although 
the nature of these is impossible to determine because the respective database tables are not handled anymore by the 
existing scripts. 

For instance, the C2 at “bannetwork.org” has an extended log of supposed victims, spanning for two years, with the earliest 
entry from 23 Sep 2011 and the latest from March 2013. 

Number of unique victims per month handled by the bannetwork.org C2 

A peak can be observed on Jan 2012 - when the attackers infected a large amount of victims, 323. 

In regards of victim’s profiles, in general, the IPs do not appear to hold useful information. Some do belong to specific 
networks, however, it’s unclear if they are researchers or true victims. A top of the ISPs for the victims at “bannetwork.org”

Links with “countlist.org” and Alexander Sokolov 

We were able to identify several older samples which connect to the command and control domain “countlist.org”. This 
domain appears to have been an active C2 between May 2010 - May 2011. The Google safe diagnostic page for this domain 
points to an interesting blog: 

 

PAGE 16  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

The domain “master-sudtyaib.narod.ru” appears to host a blog dedicated to freeing the Russian political activist “Alexander 
Sokolov” (for details: http://www.fidh.org/IMG//pdf/obs_report_russia_sokolov.pdf) . The page does not appear to be 
malicious at the time of writing of this analysis, however, the file “sokolov.html” does have an injected iframe which points to 
another domain: 

 

 

The iframe points to “countlist.org/xmps5060”, which was no longer available when we tested it. The domain “countlist.org” 
has been sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab for security reasons.

“countlist.org” is connected with the other sites - in 2010, it served PDF exploits and a dropper that delivered the Ardamax 
keylogger, which reported monitored keystrokes back to both “bannetwork.org” and “politnews.org”: 

According to KSN data, “countlist.org” served multiple versions of malicious PDF exploits from these URLs: 

countlist(dot)org/5061/

Other Teamviewer based campaigns 

We were first alerted by attacks from unknown assailants which were using runtime patched Teamviewer as part of their 
toolset in May 2012. The attacks (see https://charter97.org/ru/news/2012/4/28/51488/, story in Russian) were using a 
number of .RU domains as command and control, namely “kosmoaministrator.ru”, “adminplagin.ru” and “korakura.ru”. These 
domains are now sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab. 

 

 

PAGE 18  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

In addition to these attacks, we discovered a number of other command and control servers used by attackers which employ 
the Teamviewer-based attack toolkit. 

Based on our research, it seems the Teamviewer based trojans appeared in the Russian underground forums a couple of time 
ago and were readily available for purchase by interested parties. 

At the moment, it is unclear if there is a connection between all these attackers (such as the ones from the charter97.org 
story) and the “TeamSpy Crew”. The TeamSpy Crew differentiates itself by mostly using “.org” domains for command and 
control. On these command and control servers, they maintain a specific infrastructure and directory structure, for instance, 
serving the malicious “TeamViewer.ico” installer. 

 
Conclusions 

According to existing information, the TeamSpy crew has been active at least since 2008, possibly going back to as early as 
2004 if we are to believe the domain registration dates and consider the news aggregation channels. During the years, the 
team has been focusing on attacking a variety of targets, ranging from activists and political to heavy industry and national 
information agencies. 

Some of the aspects of this operation, such as keywords and usage of Russian terms remind us of Red October, although there 
are no direct links at the moment. If we are to compare it to Red October, the TeamSpy Crew and the tools they use are far 
less sophisticated and professional.  

To attack their targets, the TeamSpy crew relied on a variety of custom tools, designed to collect “special” and interesting 
documents, such as those containing the word “secret” in their names. The special name “saidumlo” (Georgian - “secret”) 
probably indicates at least some of the victims were in Georgia or from Georgia.  

The most recent method used by the TeamSpy crew involved the using of Teamviewer, a legal  remote administration tool. 
Since Teamviewer is normally used in a wide range of conditions, it is not normally detected by security software with default 
settings. In addition, the modules are validated  with digital signatures, once again, making them “trustworthy” to a range of 
whitelisting software. 

Unlike Red October, where many IPs could be traced to Governments and Governmental institutions based on WHOIS data, in 
this case, the vast majority of IPs belong to ISPs which do not advertise such information. In case of TeamSpy crew, except for 
a very few cases, the identity of the victims remains a mystery.

Avicap32 Dll-hijacker Module 
Known variants: 

MD5 

Compilation date 

Linker version 

Different on every system 

2012.10.22 13:53:11 (GMT) 

1.67 

  

The file is a PE EXE file written in Assembler. 

This file is a special Dll module that uses a vulnerability in TeamViewer v6 known as Dll-hijacking. If this file is stored in the 
same folder as TeamViewer.exe, then when TeamViewer is started it will show no warning, no popups, no systray icons and 
will silently continue working providing remote access to the infected machine. This module not only disables TeamViewer 
popups but also extends its functionality to the classical HTTP bot supporting a set of commands. This module installed with 
Teamviewer 6 allows the attackers to access computer desktop remotely, activate webcam or microphone, download or 
upload files to the infected machine and many more. 

DllMain 

The Module execution starts from the initialization procedure. First, the code searches for “tv.cfg” file in local directory and 
then common system paths, such as C:\Windows, C:\Windows\System32. 

The code uses non-standard way to pass some arguments to the called function. This is most likely done to harden manual 
analysis or break automated analysis of the code. 

 

 

PAGE 25  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 Non-standard push of the “tv.cfg” string offset to the stack 

If the tv.cfg file wasn't found the process exits. If it was found, the module gets unique system ID, which is a hashed value of 
system drive Volume Serial Number. To hash the Volume Serial Number two types of hash algorithms are used: custom 
SHL/SHR/OR-based algorithm and then MD5. The result is stored in a hex-string which is used as a decryption key for the tv.cfg 
and part of the code in current file. Alternatively a hash of 792 bytes of executable code from TeamViewer.exe is used for 
tv.cfg decryption.   

 

After that the module decrypts tv.cfg using RC4 algorithm. An example of decrypted tv.cfg is presented below: 

szUserAgent "Mozilla5.0" 

szadminstat "tv/getinfo.php" 

szadminhost "newslite.org" 

szfilehost "" 

nTimeOut "10000" 

nStartIdleTime "60" 

nregKey "" 

szSubKey "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" 

szValueName "svchost" 

szteampass "1234" 

nVideo "4" 

szlogftp "bannetwork.org" 

szusername "[removed]" 

szpassword "[removed]" 

szlogkey "sysenter" 

 

PAGE 26  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

 

szlogstat "log.php" 

szpostdata "id=" 

nkilltvwin7 "" 

nkilltvwinXp "" 

nfakedel "1" 

After decrypting the config, the module checks if “szadminhost” is found inside. If it is not there, the executions stops. 

Then the module decrypts string data and extra code from its own data and code section. The data is stored in TLS section of 
the parent process. 

After using some of the file parts, the module overwrites them with 0-byte values to change the module in memory and 
possibly avoid detection or dumping of the module. This is the end of initialization part. 

Next, it starts main procedure, which loads export functions from the real avicap32.dll located in system directory 
(C:\Windows\System32\). It also gets current Windows OS version and creates autorun key, under value specified in the tv.cfg. 
Currently it is 

HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\svchost 

Then the module patches the hosting TeamViewer process. It intercepts calls to the following system API functions: 

advapi32.dll: RegCreateKeyExW 

advapi32.dll: RegQueryValueExW 

kernel32.dll: CreateProcessW 

kernel32.dll: CreateMutexA 

kernel32.dll: CreateFileW 

kernel32.dll: CreateDirectoryW 

kernel32.dll: DeleteFileW 

shell32.dll: ShellExecuteExW 

user32.dll: SendMessageW 

user32.dll: CreateDialogParamW 

user32.dll: GetClassInfoExW 

user32.dll: RegisterClassExW 

user32.dll: CreateWindowExW 

user32.dll: IsWindowVisible 

user32.dll: GetDlgItem 

 

PAGE 27  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

user32.dll: ShowWindow 

user32.dll: SetWindowTextW 

user32.dll: MessageBoxW 

wintrust.dll: WinVerifyTrust 

One of the functions, SetWindowTextW, is quite interesting and contains extra code to work with C2. This functions when it is 
executed the first time has a trigger to start a couple of new threads that communicate with C2 server to ping it and get 
commands via HTTP GET request using parameters specified in tv.cfg: 

http://<server>/tv/getinfo.php?id=...&pwd=...&stat=1 

 

The server is expected to answer with one of the command from the list below: 

 

  

 

  

  

 

Next, it creates a Windows Firewall rule to allow outgoing connections for the current process, by running: “netsh firewall set 
allowedprogram <Path to the TeamViewer executable> tv” 

After that the module creates several threads, described below and proceeds to the second stage. 

In the second stage the module loads “kl.dll” library from the current directory and imports two functions: “Init” and “Rdp”. 

After that it calls “Init” function, waits 32 milliseconds allowing kl.dll to initialize and calls “Rdp” function from the same 
library. The result of that call is submitted to the C2 via HTTP Post with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
header value. 

 

 

PAGE 28  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

In parallel a new thread is created, which waits for a signal to search *.bin files in the module directory, encrypt with szlogkey 
value from tv.cfg using RC4 algorithm and upload to the FTP server specified in the tv.cfg. After uploading the files are deleted 
from the filesystem using simple DeleteFileA API call. 

Thread #1 (bot updater): 

Locates current process main executable and checks file version and file attributes. If the file version, stored in the file version 
info section is not equal to “6.0.10722.0” the process terminates. If the attributes do not contain Hidden, System, then the 
attributes are set (Hidden and System) for the file and the process is restarted. After that it will connect to the Command and 
Control (C2) server and fetch updated modules 

by the following URLs: 

http://<server name>/<filename>, where 

<server name> is a value from tv.cfg file (newslite.org). 

<filename> is one of the values from the ebedded encrypted string list: 

 

 

● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 

 
 
 
 
 
 

TeamViewer_Desktop.exe 
tv_w32.exe 
tv_x64.exe 
TeamViewer_Resource_ru.dll 
tv_w32.dll 
tv_x64.dll 

Thread #2 (self-removal): 

This thread creates a subthread which waits for a special event. If other thread fires the event, the current thread goes 
through a list of embedded filenames, which includes 

kl.dll, avicap32.dll, tv.cfg and changes file attributes to Hidden and System (which removes ReadOnly if set). After that, the 
module deletes the following registry keys: 

(HKLM or HKCU)\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\svchost 

HKCU\Software\TeamViewer\Version6\MachineFallback 

HKCU\Software\TeamViewer\Version6 

HKCU\Software\TeamViewer 

After that the thread creates and executes a batch file named “1.bat” with the following contents:

Thread #3 (watchdog): 

This thread simply monitors creation of dangerous processes, such as taskmg.exe or procexp.exe. If it finds any of these 
processes running, it immediately terminates three processes (which ids are stored in current module memory) and current 
process. This is done in a never-ending loop with high priority – sleep time between check iterations is 1 millisecond. The 
algorithm designed to have different process termination procedures for Windows NT 5.x and Windows NT 6.x, however 
currently it simply calls ExitProcess API function. 

Thread #4 (temp-cleaner): 

This thread searches for tvicap32.dll and tl.dll files in the directory of current executable. It unloads tl.dll, if it is loaded and 
then attempts to delete both files in a loop with delay of 1 second until it succeeds.

The file is a PE EXE file created in Borland Delphi. 

This file is a tool to collect all local *.plist files from user's Application Data directory. Plist or property list files are files that 
store serialized objects on Apple operating systems. These files may appear in Apple iTunes folders and may contain 
information about devices connected to the current system in the past. 

 Main 

This simple module gets searches for “*.plist” files in current user %APPDATA% directory. All discovered files are immediately 
copied to a directory with hardcoded path “%SYSTEMDRIVE%:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm”, where %SYSTEMDRIVE% is 
the system disk drive. 

 If the directory “%SYSTEMDRIVE%:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm” doesn't exist, the copying process silently fails.

10.0 

  

The file is a PE EXE file created in Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. 

This file is a tool to collect files basing on filename patterns. 

The tool has internal code in the log file: 01.01.01 

 Main 

The main procedures starts from generating output file path and creating the corresponding file: 

%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\sysdll2.txt 

  

 

 

After that the code iterates through all available logical drives and searches for the files matching the following patterns: 

 

PAGE 34  |  The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns  |  20 March 2013 

 

 

 

*.pst  - MS Outlook database files 

*.mdb - MS Access databases 

*.doc – MS Word documents 

*.rtf – RTF documents 

*pass*.* - various “password” files used by different applications 

*.pgp – PGP encrypted files 

*.pdf – PDF documents 

*.xls – MS Excel spreadsheets 

*парол* - files which contain part of Russian word “пароль” meaning “password” 

*секрет* - files which contain Russian word “секрет” meaning “secret” 

*saidumlo* - files which contain part of a Georgian transliterated word (“საიდუმლო”) meaning “secret” 

*.vmdk – files of VMware virtual machine disk files 

*.tc – files encrypted with TrueCrypt encryption software 

*.p12 – public key cryptography certificates 

 Information about discovered files will be saved in a temporary file created in %TEMP% folder and after the search is finished 
it will be copied to the following file: 

“%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\sysdll2.txt”. 

The temporary file name is created using GetTempFileNameA system API, which creates a temp file name of the following 
format: <uuuu>.TMP (where uuuu is a hexademical number picked by the system). 

 When copying the log file the module prepends a special header, so that collected file information looks as following: 

 [/N2.0-01.01.01.00:<data_length>] 

<File#1 full path> <File#1 size> <File#1 last modification time> 

<File#2 full path> <File#2 size> <File#2 last modification time> 

<File#3 full path> <File#3 size> <File#3 last modification time> 

… 

 The header probably contains internal shortened module name and version (N2.0) with some hardcoded “build id” 
(01.01.01.00), followed by the numerical value of data length that starts after the “]” character.  

  

After copying the temporary log file is deleted with call to DeleteFileA.

The file is a PE EXE file created in Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. Its size is 101’376 bytes. Its main purpose it to dump contents of 
accessible network shares. No remote file copying is done. This tool simply collects information about the files such as file size 
and file last modification time. 

 This tool is very similar to the FileList2 tool with few difference:  

It doesn't create a header in the log file and it has no internal tool ID. It also uses different application icons and resource 
section language is LANG_RUSSIAN, SUBLANG_DEFAULT. It  
also makes series of Sleep API additional calls probably to break signature based detections of some AV products. 

 Main 

The main procedures starts from generating output file path and creating the corresponding file: 

%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\sysdll2.txt 

The code makes a sequence of useless Sleep  API calls, probably to break detection of some signature-based AV engines:

The file is a PE EXE file compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. It has tiny size of 12288 bytes. Its main purpose it to log 
keystrokes, copy text from clipboard and record foreground windows along with date/time and process names owning them. 
This tool aggregates information in local folder and doesn’t upload it anywhere. It has no network functions. 

 Main 

The main procedure starts from preparation to install current application in the system. It creates a directory 
“%APPDATA%\WCF Data Services” and prepares several strings containing work paths: 

On Windows XP English with system drive C: the paths will be the following: 

LnkPath = C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\WcfAudit.lnk 

LogPath = C:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\ 

ExePath = C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\WCF Data Services\WcfAudit.exe 

XmlPath = C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\WCF Data Services\preferences.xml 

  

Next it checks existence of system event object named “__klgskot__”. If that event is found, the application exits to prevent 
multiple instances of the application from running. If event doesn‘t exist it is created immediately. 

 Next it checks if current executable is called WcfAudit.exe. If not it creates a shortcut file in the file referred above as LnkPath. 
Current executable is copied to the path referred above as ExePath. After that the process is restarted from ExePath. 

 If installation to the system is completed, the application starts three threads: 

 Thread #1 (Selfremover) 

This thread creates a system event object called “__klgkillsoft__” and waits for this event to be activated. When something 
activates this event the thread removes the LNK file from Startup folder and renames current executable from WcfAudit.exe to 
file with a decimal number in the name and no extension. The decimal number represents system tick counter value. 

 Thread#2 (Keylogger) 

This thread sets low level Windows keyboard hook, which allows the module to intercept keystrokes. The thread records all 
keystrokes, foreground window names and textual clipboard data. 

Accumulated data is available for the Thread#3 which expects it in special buffer.

 Thread#3 (Logger) 

This thread is started 30 seconds after Thread#2. It checks if XmlPath file referred above exists. If it exists it is moved to 
LogPath directory, the name is changed to klg<Number>.klg, where Number is a decimal integer taken from current system 
tick counter value. Then this file is opened and appended with new data received from Keylogger thread. Please note, that at 
least empty file at XmlPath must be created, the keylogger starts saving collected data only if it finds file at XmlPath. 

If the LogPath directory doesn’t exist, it will be created. 

 If the klg<Number>.klg file becomes larger than 1Mb, new file at XmlPath is created and moved back to LogPath directory 
with new name klg<Number>.klg (current tick counter value is used). In the end LogPath directory is full of klg<Number>.klg 
files, however there is a bug in this logics. If the system is rebooted it will not contains XmlPath will not exist and that means 
that keylogger will not be active. However it can still be activated any time by creating the XmlPath file. 

 The logs are stored in plaintext. Below is a fragment of sample log from the keylogger module: 

 *************************** C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\My Music 
*************************** [18:47 - 13/03/2013; explorer.exe;]

The file is a PE EXE file created in Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. Its size is 755’193 bytes. Its main purpose is to drop and run a 
legitimate tool known as CmdCapture, which makes a screenshot and stores it in “sysdll5.jpg” file. 

 Main 

The main procedure starts from extracting data embedded in the file of current application. 

The code prepares some working strings: 

CmdCapture = C:\ProgramDara\CmdCapture\CmdCapture.exe 

LogFile = C:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\sysdll555.txt 

LogDir = C:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\ 

 It checks magic number stored in the last 4 bytes of the file. It must be 0xFFFFAAAA. If the magic is found, it reads preceding 4 
bytes. This DWORD value (PayloadLen) indicates the size of the embedded data. Then it copies PayloadLen bytes and to the 
CmdCapture file and executes the following command: 

  

  

cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramDara\CmdCapture\CmdCapture.exe /d C:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\ /f sysdll5.jpg > 
C:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\sysdll555.txt 

After that it attempts to self-delete.

The file is a PE EXE file created in Microsoft Visual C++ 2005. Its size is 32768 bytes. Its main purpose is to collect general 
system information, including what software is installed, what services and processes are running on the system, information 
about available local storage and its free space, user accounts and BIOS information. 

  

This tool has internal code in the log file: 02.03.01 

  

 

Main 

The main procedure starts from creating a temp file (TmpLog) and preparing a path for the final 
report: %SYSTEMDRIVE%:\ProgramData\Adobe\AdobeArm\sysdll2.txt (FinalLog). 

 It runs series of commands and collects output: 

systeminfo – display general system information (OS,CPU,owner,domain,uptime,BIOS, etc); 

● 
route print – collect network routing information; 
●  netstat –r   – collect network routing information; 
●  netstat –b – display established network connections with executables owning it; 
●  netstat –a – display all connections and listening ports; 
● 
●  wmic computersystem get * /format:list – display general system information (similar to previous call); 
●  wmic os get * /format:list – detailed OS information including serial number; 
●  wmic logicaldisk get * /format:list – available system drives and their state; 
●  wmic product get * /format:list – installed applications; 
●  wmic service get * /format:list – system services and their state; 
●  wmic process get * /format:list – running processes and their details; 
●  wmic useraccount get * /format:list – available local accounts and their full details; 
●  wmic qfe get * /format:list – installed Windows Updates list. 

  

After that the output of all commands is aggregated in a single file FinalLog. Every command output is prepended with a 
header in the following format: 

<< %CommandName% >> 

 

The final log file has also got a general header in a format shown below:

The file is a PE EXE file created in Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 and packed with a Visual Basic wrapper. Its size is 40.0 KB (40,960 
bytes). 

It is a dropper designed to copy, install itself, and maintain communcations with its C2, maintain persistence, download further 
executable code, and enumerate windows looking for a browser to open and then log window contents. 

Main 

Oddly, the module concatenates a couple of strings to run commands with cmd.exe and copy itself with several names, to 
several locations, with its final location residing in the All Users\Application Data directory and a run key for itself added. First, 
it concats the string and copies itself to "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\a-t_name.exe". Then, it uses 
script commands to apply hidden attributes and further copy itself: 

 

cmd.exe /c cd C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data && attrib -H /s a-t_name.exe && rename a-
t_name.exe ie.exe" 

cmd.exe /c cd C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data && rename ie.exe iexplore.exe" 

 

This process immediately communicates with its hardcoded C2 at hxxp://www.politnews.org/dd_4.php and 
hxxp://www.bannetwork.org/dd_4.php, registering a unique identifier with its C2. It enumerates through process windows, 
looking for Internet Explorer processes and subclasses the window to steal all web browsing content and write it to 
c:\documents and settings\All Users\Application Data\sys32dll.txt, encrypting the data and sending stolen data back to the C2.
