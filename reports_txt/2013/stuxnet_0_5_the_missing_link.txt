Overview
In 2010, Symantec reported on a new and highly sophisticated worm 
called Stuxnet. This worm became known as the first computer 
software threat that was used as a cyber-weapon. The worm was 
specifically designed to take control over industrial plant machinery 
and making them operate outside of their safe or normal performance 
envelope, causing damage in the process. This was a first in the history 
of malware.

Clues in the code pointed to other versions of the worm which could 
potentially perform different actions leaving an open question about 
Stuxnet and how it came to be. The wait for the missing link is now 
over. Symantec have now discovered an older version of Stuxnet that 
can answer the questions about the evolution of Stuxnet. This newly 
discovered variant has been dissected and analyzed in detail and here 
is a summary of our key findings:

•  Stuxnet 0.5 is the oldest known Stuxnet version to be analyzed, in 

the wild as early as November 2007 and in development as early 
as November 2005.

•  Stuxnet 0.5 was less aggressive than Stuxnet versions 1.x and only 

spread through infected Step 7 projects.

•  Stuxnet 0.5 contains an alternative attack strategy, closing valves 

within the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, Iran, which 
would have caused serious damage to the centrifuges and uranium 
enrichment system as a whole.

Whether Stuxnet 0.5 was successful is unclear, but later versions of Stuxnet were developed using a different 
development framework, became more aggressive, and employed a different attack strategy that changed the 
speeds of the centrifuges instead instead suggesting Stuxnet 0.5 did not completely fulfill the attacker’s goals.

More versions of Stuxnet are known to exist, but have never been recovered.

Stuxnet 0.5 was submitted to 
a malware scanning service in 
November 2007 and could have 
began operation as early as 
November 2005. This version is 
designed to stop compromising 
computers on July 4, 2009, and 
stop communicating with its 
command-and-control (C&C) 
servers on an earlier date of 
January 11 that same year. The 
compile timestamps found within 
most of the code appear unreliable 
and generally are in the range of the year 2001.

Based on an internal version number 
this version of Stuxnet is 0.5, the 
earliest known version of the Stuxnet 
family.

The only method of replication in 
Stuxnet 0.5 is through infection of 
Siemens Step 7 project files. Stuxnet 
0.5 does not exploit any Microsoft 
vulnerabilities, unlike versions 1.x 
which came later.

There are differences in exploited 
vulnerabilities and spreading 
mechanisms between Stuxnet 
versions.

Stuxnet 0.5 is partly based on the Flamer platform whereas 1.x versions were based primarily on the Tilded 
platform. Over time, the developers appear to have migrated more towards the Tilded platform. The developers 
actually re-implemented Flamer-platform components using the Tilded platform in later versions.

Both the Flamer and Tilded platform code bases are different enough to suggest different developers were 
involved. 

Stuxnet 0.5 also contains code to attack the valve systems in a uranium enrichment facility rather than 
modifying centrifuge speeds, as in versions 1.x of Stuxnet.

Installation and load point

Stuxnet 0.5 arrives as an infected Step 7 project archive containing both the s7hkimdb.dll and XR000001.MDX 
files. Using the Multiple Siemens SIMATIC Products DLL Loading Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-
2012-3015), the S7hkimdb.dll file is executed, which then decrypts and injects the main XR00001.MDX Stuxnet 
binary file into the services.exe process. Stuxnet is now executing on the system.

Once injected into the services.exe process, a copy of the main Stuxnet binary and a companion DLL that 
implements the payload are saved to disk in encrypted form along with a MRXCLS.SYS load point driver.  The 
main Stuxnet binary refers to itself as outbreak.dll and is saved to disk as oem7a.pnf.  The companion DLL that 
implements the payload refers to itself as installation.dll and saved to disk as oem7w.pnf.  When the system is 
booted, the MRXCLS.SYS load point driver will decrypt configuration data stored in the registry, decrypt the 
main Stuxnet binary, and inject it into the Explorer and Step 7 processes. The payload DLL will be decrypted as 
well and injected into the Explorer process. When loading dynamic-link library (DLL) resources, Stuxnet makes 
use of a module that mimics LoadLibrary rather than calling LoadLibrary itself. This technique is likely 
used to avoid security software and was not seen in versions 1.x of Stuxnet.

A second driver, PCIBUS.SYS, is also created which causes a forced reboot by generating a BSoD (Blue Screen of 
Death) 20 days after installation.

A third driver, USBACC11.SYS, is then installed. This driver is similar to the MRXCLS.SYS driver, but instead 
decrypts and injects DLLs for peer-to-peer and C&C communication into the svchost.exe and Internet Explorer 
processes.

The structure and organization as well as resource and export listings of each component is available in 
Appendix D.

Stuxnet 0.5 also checks the current date in a variety of code paths and will not continue to spread after July 4, 
2009. Certain modules may also not be created or loaded if security software is present. A list is available in 
Appendix B.

A variety of additional files are created, including log files and configuration files. A list is available in Appendix 
A.

Replication

Stuxnet 0.5 uses one form of replication through Step 7 project archives. When a removable drive is inserted in 
an infected system, Stuxnet 0.5 will infect any Step 7 project archives with a .s7p or .zip file name extension on 
the drive. In addition, Step 7 project archives on the local disk will also be infected.

Therefore Stuxnet 0.5 spreads to additional machines through removable drives or through human-initiated 
sharing of infected Step 7 project archives, for example through email.

Stuxnet 0.5 infects Step 7 project archives in the same manner as Stuxnet 1.x versions (as described in W32.

project file.

hOmSave7/subfolder/s7hkimdb.dll - loader

Command-and-control

Similar to Stuxnet 1.x versions, Stuxnet 0.5 has limited command-and-control ability. In particular, Stuxnet 
0.5 does not provide fine grained control to its authors. Instead, Stuxnet 0.5 can only download new code and 
update itself. Stuxnet needs to ultimately spread on isolated networks with no Internet access, therefore it has 
been designed to be autonomous to reduce the need for robust and fine grained command-and-control. Stuxnet 
0.5 also uses a secondary peer-to-peer mechanism to propagate these code updates to peers on networks 
inaccessible to the broader Internet.

Command-and-control is implemented by the inetpsp.dll file while peer-to-peer communications are 
implemented by the netsimp32.dll file. Both files are loaded by the usbacc11.sys driver and then injected into 
the svchost.exe and iexplore.exe processes.

Stuxnet 0.5 has four C&C servers, all of which are now either unavailable or have since been registered by an 
unrelated party:
•  smartclick.org
•  best-advertising.net
•  internetadvertising4u.com
•  ad-marketing.net
Interestingly, Stuxnet 0.5 is programmed to stop contacting the C&C server after January 11, 2009, even though 
the threat is programmed to only stop spreading after a later date of July 4, 2009. 

Figure 1

Internet advertising agency homepage for Stuxnet C&C servers

The C&C server domains were 
created in 2005 and all displayed 
the same front page purporting 
to be an Internet advertising 
agency named Media Suffix 
(figure 1) with the tag line 
“Believe What the Mind Can 
Dream”.

The servers were hosted on 
commercial hosting providers 
in the United States, Canada, 
France, and Thailand. The fact 
that these domains were in 
operation since 2005, suggests 
that the Stuxnet project started 
more than seven years ago.

Page 4

The first request by Stuxnet 0.5 uses the following form:

http://<domain>/cgi/link.php?site=xx

This notifies the C&C server of an active successful infection. Next, Stuxnet 0.5 sends the following request:

http://<domain>/cgi/click.php?xite=xx&num=yy&c=1&j=%x&k=%x&l=%x

This may download and execute a file if an update is available.

The final target network for Stuxnet 0.5 was likely isolated from the Internet. To allow updates to reach these 
machines, Stuxnet 0.5 also used a peer-to-peer mechanism. As long as one updated version was introduced into 
this network—for example through an infected USB key—all the other infected machines on the network could 
receive updates or new code modules.

Stuxnet 0.5 uses Windows mailslots for peer-to-peer communication. Mailslots allow a process to pass a 
message to another process on a remote machine. Stuxnet 0.5 enumerates all machines on the network and 
attempts to connect to a mailslot named \\[REMOTE MACHINE NAME]\mailslot\svchost. It then provides 
a callback mailslot name of \\[LOCAL MACHINE NAME]\mailslot\imnotify.
Stuxnet 0.5 uses these mailslots for peer-to-peer communication and to pass code updates. In addition, Stuxnet 
0.5 may configure systems to allow anonymous logins and then provides the following file shares:

•  temp$
•  msagent$
•  SYSADMIN$
•  WebFiles$

This allows file retrieval by peer infections. Shared files include:
%WinDir%\msagent\agentsb.dll
%WinDir%\msagent\intl\agt0f2e.dll
%WinDir%\system32\complnd.dll
%WinDir%\system32\dllcache\datacprs.dll
%WinDir%\system32\wbem\perfnws.dll
%WinDir%\Installer\{6F716D8C-398F-11D3-85E1-005004838609}\places.dat

Payload

Man-in-the-Middle

In order to both fingerprint the target system and inject malicious Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) code, 
Stuxnet 0.5 replaces two Step 7 DLLs in order to hijack communications with a PLC.

The first DLL, s7otbxdx.dll, is hijacked in order to insert the malicious PLC code. The same technique was used in 
Stuxnet versions 1.x (as described in W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Modifying PLCs). Stuxnet 0.5 hooks fewer exports and 
verifies the CPU is a 417 PLC rather than a 315 PLC, otherwise the behavior remains generally the same.

The second DLL, s7aaapix.dll, is used for fingerprinting the target system and building DB8061, a PLC data block 
needed to conduct the attack. The export AUTDoVerb is hijacked and the malicious s7otbxdx.dll file can call the 
export with magic values (0x91E55A3D, 0x996AB716, 0x4A5CBB03) in order to build or provide a previously 
built DB8061 data block for injection. Stuxnet hijacks AUTDoVerb in order to monitor any “DOWNLOAD” verb 
actions, which signifies the fingerprinting and building of DB8061 must occur again in order to ensure the target 
system is still correctly configured.

Page 5

Fingerprinting and building DB8061
The building of the DB8061 block is a complicated and 
lengthy process.

Through the hijacked export, Stuxnet 0.5 will receive a 
pointer to the most recently used block (PLC programs 
consist of code and data blocks). Stuxnet 0.5 will then 
traverse the project structure in order to find the symbols 
used by the S7 Program in the active project. Symbols 
are human designated labels representing each device 
controlled by the PLC. The symbol labels loosely follow the 
ANSI/ISA S5.1 Instrumentation Symbols and Identification 
standard used in Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams 
(P&ID).

Stuxnet 0.5 uses these labels for both fingerprinting and 
determining the addresses of each device in order to modify 
the behavior of those devices.

Symbol label parsing
The target system must be a SIMATIC 400 Station 
(0x14109A) or SIMATIC H-Station (0x141342), which use 
417 PLCs. The symbol labels must match the format:
<delimiter><FunctionIdentifier><delimiter><C
ascadeModule><delimiter><CascadeNumber><Dev
iceNumber>
A valve in module A21, also in cascade 8, and associated with centrifuge 160, would have the symbol label PV-
A21-8-160, for example.

Each field is defined as follows:

Delimiter
Either space (“ “), hyphen (“-”), underscore (“_”), or not present at all.

FunctionIdentifer
A string that matches a set of strings (available in Appendix C) that loosely follows the ANSI/ISA S5.1 
Instrumentation Symbols and Identification standard. If the string is “PIA” (Pressure Indicator Alarm), it is 
expected to be followed by a one digit number. These strings will represent the device type (a valve, a transducer, 
or a status light, for instance).

CascadeModule
Must be the string “A21” to “A28” inclusive. These strings match cascade modules in Natanz, Iran, seen publicly 
described as “A24”, “A26”, and “A28”.

CascadeNumber
Single character that is in the letter range A to R. If it is not in this letter range, it checks to see if it is two digits 
in the decimal range 00 to 18. This two digit number is the number representation of the letter for A to R.

Page 6

DeviceNumber
This is parsed in a more complex fashion depending on the device type as determined by the function identifier 
and caters to three possible cascade arrangements. The device type mappings to function identifiers are 
available in Appendix C.

Device type 0
A string of digits: If the length of the digits is less than three, the device type is changed to device type 6. If 
the length of the digits is greater than or equal to three, the device type is changed to device type 7.

Device type 1, 2, 3
“##”: A two digit number in the range 1 to 25.

Device type 4, 5, or 7
Device type 4, 5, or 7 has three different formats:

Format 1
“####”: Decoded as two separate two-digit numbers representing the stage number and the centrifuge 
number within the stage, respectively. The stage number must be in the decimal range 1 to 15, which 
matches with the known Natanz configuration. For each of these 15 stages, the maximum number of 
expected centrifuges in each corresponding stage is looked up in the following array.

This means, for example, stage 3 is expected to have a second two digit number equal to 4 or less. This 
requirement is consistent with the centrifuge arrangement within a cascade.

Format 2
“###”: A three digit number that must be less than 164, which is the number of centrifuges in a cascade.

Format 3
“##L”: A two digit number followed by a letter. The letter must be in the range A to D, and the number 
must be in the decimal range 1 to 43. This arrangement sub-divides each stage into sub-clusters of four.

Device type 6
“##”: A two digit number in the range 1 to 30.

Device type 8, 9, B, or C
“##”: A two digit number in the range 1 to 3.

Page 7

Device type A
“##<delimiter><string>”: A two digit number in the range 1 to 3 with an optional string preceded by a 
delimiter character. The string must start with the letter S and contain the letter P. If the string is present, 
the device is modified to be device type 0xB instead (Flow Rate Transmitter Controller Output, rather than 
device type 0xA which is Flow Rate Transmitter Controller Input).

Based on the symbol fingerprinting, the following table summarizes what devices and labels Stuxnet looks for 
within the symbol table.

Symbol address parsing
Each symbol label will have two corresponding addresses:  -- the address in the process image area and the 
direct peripheral address of the device represented by the symbol. Modifying the memory at these addresses 
allows the PLC to control and read the behavior of the associated device. For example, the value may be a 
Boolean value turning a switch on or off, or a 16-bit value representing the current temperature of the system. 
Addresses can be either outputs (the PLC sets the value to modify the behavior of the device) or inputs (the PLC 
reads the value to determine the current state of the device).

Device types 0, 1, 5, and B must be output addresses and device types 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, and C must be 
input addresses.

Values at addresses for device types 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 must be bit values. Values at addresses for device types 
6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, and C must be 16-bit values.

Cascade rating and building DB8061
After parsing the symbols and addresses for each cascade, the code inspects the configuration of each cascade. 
Depending on the configuration, a rating is calculated. Certain devices in certain configurations will result in 
higher ratings. When complete, only the six highest-rated cascades have data written to DB8061.

Finally, a flag is set signifying DB8061 has been built. This flag is reset to 0 every time the “DOWNLOAD” verb is 
executed.

Page 8

PLC device attack code

The code conducts an attack by closing valves in the six top rated cascades out of the possible 18 cascades. The 
states of two types of valves are modified:

•  Centrifuge valves – a set of three valves (feed, product, tails) that work in unison per centrifuge to control 

uranium hexafluoride (UF6) flow into each centrifugeStage valves – one per stage to control UF6 flow into each 
stage

•  Auxiliary valves – valves that control UF6 flow into or out of each stage (stage valve) or the cascade as a whole

Figure 2

Example valve configuration showing both valve types in three stages of a cascade

Similar to version 1.x of Stuxnet, the PLC device attack code consists of a state machine with eight possible 
states:

State 0 (Wait): Perform system identification and wait for the enrichment process to reach steady state before 
attack. This can take approximately 30 days.

State 1 (Record): Take peripheral snapshots and build fake input blocks for replaying later. 

State 2 (Attack centrifuge valves): Begin replaying fake input signals. Close valves on most centrifuges. 

State 3 (Secondary pressure reading): Open both centrifuge and feed stage valves in the final stage of a single 
cascade to obtain a low pressure reading.

Page 9

State 4 (Wait for pressure change): Wait for desired pressure change or time limit. This can take up to 
approximately two hours.

State 5 (Attack auxiliary valves): Open all auxiliary valves except valves believed to be near the first feed stage 
(stage 10). Wait for three minutes in this state.

State 6 (Wait for attack completion): Wait for six minutes while preventing any state changes.

State 7 (Finish): Reset and return to state zero.

Figure 3

State flow diagram of 417 PLC device attack code

State 0:

The code verifies the system has reached steady state by monitoring the state of each auxiliary valve and the 
amount of elapsed time.
•  The valves must not change state for a period of 300 snapshots. In addition, the code determines if most of the 

centrifuge valves are in the open or closed position.

•  All cascades must be operational for three or more days, or currently be in the down state.
•  At least one cascade must have been operating for more than 35 days, or collectively all cascades must have 

been operating for more than 297 days.

•  Between 3 and 7 of the first 21 auxiliary valves must have been opened in the last 2 days.

Page 10

•  Most of the pressure readings associated with the auxiliary valves must be within an expected range.
Only if these all conditions are met does the code proceed to state 1.

State 1:

There are 21 snapshots of the peripheral I/O values that are taken one second apart. These values are stored for 
replay during the attack. This prevents systems and technicians from realizing the system is no longer operating as 
expected.

State 2:

First, the normal operating pressure is obtained and stored for replay later. For each stage a portion of all the 
centrifuge valves are closed, except in the feed stage (stage 10). The centrifuge valves in the feed stage remain 
completely open, while the centrifuge valves at both the product end and tails end are completely closed.

The particular centrifuge valves closed per stage are randomly chosen. The code will randomly chose a starting 
centrifuge valve and then close the next one in order until the last centrifuge valve in the stage. If the total desired 
number of valves to close for that stage has not been reached, the code will continue from the first centrifuge valve 
in the stage until the maximum valves to close are reached.

State 3:

In state 3, in a single cascade, both centrifuge valves in stage 1 are opened and it is likely the stage valve of stage 1 is 
also opened. Then, the code obtains a pressure reading at stage 1. The pressure should be relatively low.  This value 
is used for replay in later stages. If the normal pressure operating pressure wasn’t obtained properly in state 2, state 
3 is actually skipped and hardcoded default values are used instead.

State 4:

State 4 waits for the desired pressure change or other predetermined time limits before proceeding to state 5. If any 
of the following conditions are met, the code will continue to state 5:
•  The pressure of the stage 10 or stage 11 transducer (these are likely transducers for or near the feed stage) has an 

absolute value greater than 280 units above the expected value and greater than five times the expected value.

•  46 minutes after the state of an auxiliary valve has been modified from the original state recorded in state 1, with 

the exception of auxiliary valve number 17 which is likely a stage valve near the product end.

•  2 hours and 3 minutes after the attack started (since state 2) without any centrifuge valve state changes.
•  2 hours and 3 minutes since at least four centrifuge valve states have been modified from the original state 

recorded in state 1.

State 5:

In state 5, all the auxiliary valves are opened except valve numbers 17, 18, and 20. Before continuing to state 6, the 

Page 11

code waits for at least 2 minutes and 53 seconds.

State 6:

During state 6, fake values continue to be replayed and any attempts to change device values are prevented for 6 
minutes and 58 seconds.

State 7:

Data is reset and the code returns to state 0.

By closing all valves except the initial feed stage valves, UF6 will continue to flow into the system.  This act alone 
may cause damage to the centrifuges themselves. However, the attack expects the pressure to reach five times the 
normal operating pressure. At this pressure, significant damage to the uranium enrichment system could occur and 
the UF6 gas could even revert to a solid.

Whether the attack succeeded in this manner or not remains unclear. Even if the attack did succeed, the attackers 
decided to move to a different strategy in the Stuxnet 1.x versions, attacking the speed of the centrifuges instead.

Conclusion

Stuxnet 0.5 clarifies the evolution and history of Stuxnet. Stuxnet clearly became more aggressive over time and 
switched development platforms as it evolved from 0.5 versions to later 1.x versions.

Key parts of the 417 attack code missing from versions 1.x is fully implemented in Stuxnet 0.5. This demonstrates 
that the 417 attack code was the first attack strategy implemented by Stuxnet. This original 417 attack code 
attempted to modify valve states during the uranium enrichment process at Natanz, Iran, to cause damage to the 
centrifuges and the system as a whole.

The success of Stuxnet 0.5 remains 
unknown. However, the chart 
in figure 4 references uranium 
enrichment production at Natanz 
to key milestones of Stuxnet 
development. Interesting events 
are dips in feed or production 
amounts and lower levels of 
production given the same or 
greater feed amounts (shown as 
gaps between the two lines).

While the discovery of Stuxnet 
0.5 helps to deepen our overall 
understanding of Stuxnet and 
what its goals are, versions remain 
unrecovered. If these are located, 
they may expose other secrets 
behind this operation and more 
clues to its origins, but obtaining 
these other samples may prove to 
be next to impossible.
