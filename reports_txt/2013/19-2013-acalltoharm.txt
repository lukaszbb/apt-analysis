A Call to Harm: 

New Malware Attacks Target the Syrian Opposition 

Authors: John Scott-Railton and Morgan Marquis-Boire 

 

 

SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS 

  Malware masquerading as the circumvention tool Freegate. 

  A campaign masquerading as a call to arms by a pro-opposition cleric. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

Syria’s opposition has faced persistent targeting by Pro-Government Electronic Actors (PGEAs) throughout 
the Syrian civil war. A pro-government group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army has gained visibility in 
recent months with high profile attacks against news organizations. Meanwhile, Syrian activists continue to be 
targeted with online attacks apparently for the purposes of accessing their private communications and stealing 
their secrets. 

Throughout 2012, attacks against the Syrian opposition were documented in an extensive series of blog posts 
by Morgan Marquis-Boire and Eva Galperin with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.1 Many others 
have also contributed to research on Syrian malware, from Telecomix to a range of security companies. 
Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition, and several groups working closely with it, such as Cyber Arabs, have been 
active in attempting to identify potential threats and warn users. 

Researchers have identified a common theme among the attacks against the Syrian opposition: sophisticated 
social engineering that is grounded in an awareness of the needs, interests, and weaknesses of the opposition. 
Attacks often play on curiosity or ideology to encourage users to enter passwords or click on enticing files, or 
exploit fears of hacking and surveillance with fake security tools. Attacks are often transmitted to potential 
victims from the accounts of people with whom they are familiar.

The two attacks that are described in this blogpost follow this theme. One is a malicious installer of the 
circumvention tool Freegate. The other is an e-mail attachment calling for jihad against Hezbollah and the 
Assad regime or promising interesting regional news.

ATTACK 1: A HELPING OF MALWARE WITH THAT PROXY? 

In this attack, which we first observed in the second week of June, the potential victim is encouraged to visit a 
download link containing a malicious installer of Freegate. 

Freegate is a standalone circumvention-bypassing Virtual Private Network (VPN) client for Windows. 
Legitimate versions of the Freegate software are available for download on its website. While initially 
developed for mainland Chinese users, the software is used in a number of other countries. 

While Freegate was erroneously labelled a Trojan by one anti-virus company nearly a decade ago, in this 
attack, attackers packaged what appears to be a legitimate version of Freegate with a malicious implant.2 The 
targeted group were members of the Syrian opposition in a private social media group. 

 
http://www.mediafire.com/download/[REDACTED]/VPN-Pro.zip 
 
 

When a potential victim visits the link, they are offered the download of a file which MediaFire lists as 
uploaded on June 15, 2013. 

 
VPN-PRO.zip3 
Uploaded: 2013-06-15 16:54:31

Similar to previously observed malware attacks targeting the Syrian opposition, this was written in .NET and 
appears to require the .NET 3.5 framework to execute.5 

When VPN-Pro.exe is run, the victim is shown the Freegate end-user license agreement (EULA) dialogue 
box.6 Upon agreeing to the EULA, an operational copy of Freegate proxy is launched, which includes a 
request to unblock the firewall. The copy of Freegate launched is listed as “Freegate 7.35 Professional 
Edition.” The Freegate software begins operating, and quickly prompts the user for an update.

ShadowTech Rat is a Remote Access Trojan which appears to be widely available for download on both 
English and Arabic language sites. Videos can be found on YouTube demonstrating its functionality. The tool 
offers a range of options to the attacker, from keylogging and remote activation of the webcam to file 
exfiltration.

Both VPN-Pro.exe and svhost.exe have been submitted to VirusTotal: 

 

Both have relatively low detection rates by anti-virus software. As of June 20, 2013, svchost.exe was only 
detected by four out of 47 tested anti-virus programs, while VPN-Pro.exe was only detected by five out of 46. 

The svchost.exe initiates an outbound connection to a command and control (C2) server hosted at 
thejoe.publicvm.com. This domain resolves to an address inside Syrian IP space:  31.9.48.119.

This is not the first time that malicious installer packages have been created for circumvention tools. In 2012, 
malicious installers for Green Simurgh—a standalone proxy intended for Iranian users but also used by some 
Syrians—were found in circulation. The creators of Green Simurgh responded by posting a prominent 
warning on their website highlighting the presence of these malicious installers. Last year, malware which 
purported to be the Tor Browser Bundle was found in the wild. It was found to be backdoored by Gh0st RAT 
and exfiltrated data to an IP in China. 

An attack using a malicious installer of a working and reputable security or proxy tool is especially pernicious 
as it targets users who likely recognize the importance of privacy and circumvention, and may believe that 
they have increased their privacy and security by installing the tool. 

 

ATTACK 2: A TARGETED CALL TO ARMS 

In this campaign, contact with targets was initiated through phishing e-mails, chat messages and Facebook 
posts. Although we became aware of this campaign in early June, we have evidence that it may have started as 
early as January 2013. We believe that this campaign targeted—at least in part—high-profile members of the 
Syrian opposition. Interestingly, the attack included targeting of at least one non-public address associated 
with internal opposition communications. This indicates some degree of prior penetration of the opposition—
either through computer network intrusion or other intelligence gathering activities. 

The potential victim in this attack first receives a message from an unknown source, in this case, a Gmail 
account with a nondescript name. 

Example e-mail:

Number 18 –  June 2013 
 

The e-mail contains text, an image (not shown), and an attachment. The text refers to a video of Sheikh Adnan 
al-Arour—a Sunni pro-opposition cleric—based in Saudi Arabia, calling for holy war against Assad and 
Hezbollah. The user is led to believe that opening the zip file, which is descriptively titled as being the 
Sheikh’s opinion, will provide access to the video. 

While we have identified multiple different attacks with different zip files, the structure of all of these is 
consistent with the example described here. 

 

Example zip files: 

 

ئلإا ب روعرع لا نا ندع خي ش لا يأر .zip9 

يروس لا ين طو لا فلا ت
داهج لا نل ع ي روعرع لا نا ندع خي ش لا – ط بار .zip

اهن ع يق ي ق ح لا لوؤس م لاو ق يو ق ره ن ةرزجم لوح ادج صاخ.zip 
 

 

The zip file extracts to a Windows Shortcut file with the same name and a .lnk extension. 

Example .lnk file “Sample A”:

CONCLUSIONS 

As the conflict in Syria drags on, digital campaigns targeting Syrian opposition have persisted. We have 
chosen to highlight two attacks that are part of recent efforts by Pro-Government Electronic Actors to 
compromise opposition communications and steal their secrets. 

These attacks cater to the opposition’s communication behaviors and tactics. They are indicative of a 
combination of prior intelligence about the opposition, and ingenuity in social engineering. For example, 
many in the Syrian opposition are now aware of the electronic threats they face and seek out tools to increase 
their communications security and privacy. Tools and information about security and communications are in 
constant circulation. Some of this material addresses well-defined vulnerabilities. We have observed a greater 
degree of care among many in the opposition when facing certain situations that were common attack 
modalities in 2012. As awareness grows and behavior evolves, we suspect that some of the attacks that we 
regularly observed in 2012 are much less successful today. 

Some of the information and practices that are shared between users, however, are much less appropriate, even 
inadvertently dangerous. For example, many legitimate tools are shared via third party file sharing sites or 
over social media. This situation presents a rich variety of targets for attackers in which to seed malicious 
binaries and links masquerading as familiar or desirable tools. 

We infer that from the point of view of these attackers, not all attacks need to have sophisticated malware in 
order to be successful enough to be worth doing. Yet, perhaps in response to the growing awareness of 
previous and often widely targeted attacks against the Syrian opposition, attackers continue to innovate and 

 

15 

experiment with new techniques that blend social engineering with new attack styles. The experiments are 
sometimes clearly successful. For example, in the case of Attack 2, the Windows shortcut files were not 
conclusively identified as malicious by even savvy opposition members for an extended period of time. 

We hope that this post will increase awareness of the two attacks among potential targets. In the meantime, 
users who have executed either the fake Freegate file or clicked on one of the Windows shortcut files should 
consider their computers and accounts compromised.

APPENDIX: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FREEGATE AND FREEGATE USERS 

The Freegate website is blocked in China (its primary target market), as is the case with other similar 
circumvention tools. To get around blocking, tools are often distributed between individuals, or through 
untrusted downloads from third party sites. This is an unfortunate vector for attackers to distribute malicious 
installers and bundles that also contain functional versions of the program. As demonstrated by our work on 
the Freegate malware, as well as the Green Simurgh case, these vulnerabilities are exploited with serious 
consequences for high-risk users. 

We understand the resource constraints that developers of free security and circumvention software often face. 
As such, we propose two simple steps that Freegate could take to help mitigate the current and similar future 
threats. 

  1) Freegate should take steps to make their users aware of the threat. 

We provided Freegate developers with details of the attack, copies of the malicious binary, and other 
details prior to publication. We would like to point them towards the example established by Green 
Simurgh, who promptly posted a multilingual warning to their website when a malicious repackaging 
of their tool was found to be targeting Syrian users. We have offered to help them translate any 
warning materials into Arabic. 

  2) Freegate should implement by-default HTTPS on their website. 

Currently, visitors to the Freegate website follow non-HTTPS links to an unencrypted download. We 
believe that this presents a clear risk for man-in-the-middle attacks. Most developers of similar anti-
censorship, circumvention, and security tools have implemented this security measure. We encourage 
Freegate to follow suit.
