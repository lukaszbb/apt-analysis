Introduction

The perpetrators of targeted attacks aim to maintain persistent presence in a 
target network in order to extract sensitive data when needed. To maintain 
persistent presence, attackers seek to blend in with normal network traffic 
and use ports that are typically allowed by firewalls. As a result, many of the 
malware used in targeted attacks utilize the HTTP and HTTPS protocols to 
appear like web traffic. However, while these malware do give attackers full 
control over a compromised system, they are often simple and configured to 
carry out a few commands.

Attackers often use remote access Trojans (RATs), which typically have 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and remote desktop features that include 
directory browsing, file transfer, and the ability to take screenshots and 
activate the microphone and web camera of a compromised computer. 
Attackers often use publicly available RATs like Gh0st, PoisonIvy, Hupigon, 
and DRAT, and “closed-released” RATs like MFC Hunter and PlugX.1 However, 
the network traffic these RATs produce is well-known and easily detectable 
although attackers still successfully use them.2

Attackers always look for ways to blend their malicious traffic with legitimate 
traffic to avoid detection. We found a family of RATs that we call “FAKEM” that 
make their network traffic look like various protocols. Some variants attempt 
to disguise network traffic to look like Windows® Messenger and Yahoo!® 
Messenger traffic. Another variant tries to make the content of its traffic look 
like HTML. While the disguises the RATs use are simple and distinguishable 
from legitimate traffic, they may be just good enough to avoid further scrutiny.

Distribution

All three versions of the FAKEM RAT that we investigated were distributed via 
spear-phishing emails using social engineering to lure targets into executing 
a malicious attachment. While we observed the use of different themes, the 
content of the emails were always interesting to potential targets.

FIGURE 1: Sample spear-phishing emails with attachments that drop FAKEM RAT

The malicious attachments were most often Microsoft® Word® documents 
with code that exploits the following vulnerabilities:

•  CVE-2010-3333: RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability addressed in 

Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-087.3

•  CVE-2012-0158: MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE Vulnerability addressed in Microsoft 

Security Bulletin MS12-027.4

We also found a Microsoft® Excel® file that exploits CVE-2009-3129, the Excel 
Featheader Record Memory Corruption Vulnerability addressed in Microsoft 
Security Bulletin MS09-067.5 We also saw samples that were simply executable 
(.EXE) files.

Installation

After exploitation, an .EXE file packed with UPX is dropped.6 After initially 
dropping the malicious file named hkcmd.exe to the %Temp% folder, the 
malware typically copies itself using the name, tpframe.exe, to the %System% 
folder.

It then adds the following registry entry to enable its automatic execution at 
every system startup:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ 
Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\run 
tpbar = “%System%\tpframe.exe”

Backdoor

The network traffic the malware produces is designed to look like Windows 
Messenger traffic. Malware of this type were discussed on Twitter, noted by 
SonicWALL, and found to have been active as far back as September 2009.7 
However, it remains unclear if all the attacks that used this malware were 
connected.

The malicious traffic begins with headers similar to actual Windows Messenger 
traffic:

MSG 5 N 130 
MIME-Version: 1.0

However, beyond this, you will see that the traffic is not valid Windows 
Messenger traffic but may be sufficiently disguised as such to escape further 
scrutiny.

6  UPX is a free tool that compresses executable files. However, it is commonly used to pack 

malware files, see http://upx.sourceforge.net/ for more details.

traffic

Compared with actual Windows Messenger traffic shown in Figure 3, it is easy 
to distinguish the malicious traffic shown in Figure 2.

During our investigation of the fake “Windows Messenger” RAT, we found 
another version that attempts to disguise its network traffic as Yahoo! 
Messenger traffic. The network communication this version uses begins with 
YMSG, the Yahoo! Messenger traffic header.

FIGURE 4: Malicious traffic disguised as 

Yahoo! Messenger traffic

FIGURE 5: Legitimate Yahoo! Messenger 

traffic

However, the network traffic shown in Figure 4 does not resemble legitimate 
Yahoo! Messenger traffic beyond the use of the header, YMSG. Compared 
with the legitimate Yahoo! Messenger traffic shown in Figure 5, it is easy to 
distinguish between the two.

A third version of the FAKEM RAT attempts to disguise the network traffic it 
produces as HTML. The malicious traffic begins with strings like 
<html><title>1..56</title><body> or <html><title>12356</title><body>.8

8  This variant was referenced during an incident documented by AlienVault in March 2012 in 
http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/alienvault-research-used-as-lure-in-targeted-
attacks/.

This is a fairly rudimentary disguise 
and odd because you would expect 
HTML to be the result of a request to 
a web server and not as something a 
client would send to a web server.

Network Traffic Encryption

The network communication between the compromised computer and the RAT 
controller is encrypted. The encryption is the same across variants and done 
at the bit level. Each byte is XOR-ed by every letter in the string, YHCRA, 
and rotated 3 bits to the right after every XOR operation. Encrypting the 
communication ensures that the suspicious data passed between the 
compromised host and the attackers cannot be easily viewed in plain text. The 
communication comes in 1024-byte blobs of data that start with the 32-byte 
header. It appears that attackers may specify any kind of fake headers within 
the first 32 bytes in order to disguise the subsequent network traffic.

The following bits of information are initially sent by the compromised host 
when the communication starts:

•  User name

•  Computer name

•  OEM code page identifier

•  What looks like a campaign code but only for some samples

The commands are not preconfigured as the malware relies on the data sent by 
the server. For instance, when a client receives the command, 0211, this 
signifies that it should execute the accompanying data in memory.

The following are the commands the server issues and their meanings:

•  0211: Execute code.

•  0212: Reconnect to receive data.

•  0213: Sleep, close socket, and reconnect.

•  0214: Exit.

To determine the RAT’s capabilities, we allowed the attackers to infiltrate a 
honeypot computer and captured all of the network traffic it generated. We 
decrypted the network traffic and determined the commands the attackers 
used, which include:

•  CmdMana: Command Manager allows attackers to execute shell 

commands.

•  FileMan: File Manager allows the attackers to browse directories.

•  HostIn: Host Information provides information about the compromised 

computer.

•  ProcMan: Process Manager gives attackers access to running processes.

•  RegMana: Registry Manager gives attackers access to the Windows 

registry.

•  Scree: Screen takes a snapshot of the desktop.

•  ServiceMa: Service Manager allows access to services.

•  Passwo: Password accesses stored passwords like those saved in Internet 

Explorer (IE).

•  UStea: Uploads files from a compromised computer.

Infrastructure

The Windows Messenger samples we analyzed were clustered into five groups 
that did not have overlapping linkages. Four of the clusters were relatively 
small and focused on four different domains:

•  vcvcvcvc.dyndns.org

•  zjhao.dtdns.net

•  avira.suroot.com

•  *.googmail.com

The vcvcvcvc.dyndns.org domain is particularly interesting because we also 
found it being used as a command-and-control (C&C) server for Protux—a well-
known malware family that has been used in many targeted attacks over the 
years. We also found that the avira.suroot.com domain used as a C&C server 
for yet another malware family we call “cxgid.”

The *.googmail.com domain was slightly larger and included names like 
apple12.crabdance.com and apple12.co.cc. However, the largest cluster 
revolved around the *.yourturbe.org domain and overlapped with the HTML 
variant. We also found small clusters of the HTML variant that revolved around 
the domain, endless.zapto.org, which was downloaded as a second-stage 
malware by Protux.

Meanwhile, the Yahoo! Messenger samples we analyzed all accessed freeavg.
sytes.net—a domain name that frequently resolved to different IP addresses.

FIGURE 8: FAKEM domains associated with the Yahoo! Messenger variant

The various samples we collected appear to belong to groups that overlapped a 
little. This suggests that rather than being associated with a particular 
campaign, the use of various FAKEM RATs could be distributed among multiple 
threat actors.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the attack tools, techniques, and infrastructure of adversaries is 
critical for developing defensive strategies. This research paper examined three 
variants of a RAT—FAKEM—that attempt to disguise the network traffic they 
produce to stay under the radar.

Now that popular RATs like Gh0st and PoisonIvy have become well-known and 
can easily be detected, attackers are looking for methods to blend in with 
legitimate traffic. While it is possible to distinguish the network traffic FAKEM 
RAT variants produce for the legitimate protocols they aim to spoof, doing so in 
the context of a large network may not be not easy. The RAT’s ability to mask 
the traffic it produces may be enough to provide attackers enough cover to 
survive longer in a compromised environment.

Fortunately, solutions like Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery can help network 
administrators protect their organizations from attacks that use the FAKEM 
RAT by detecting the traffic its variants produce.
