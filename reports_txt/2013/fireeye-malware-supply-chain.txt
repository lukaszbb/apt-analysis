Executive Summary
Many seemingly unrelated cyber attacks may, in 
fact, be part of a broader offensive fueled by a 
shared development and logistics 
infrastructure—a finding that suggests some 
targets are facing a more organized menace than 
they realize.

This report examines 11 advanced persistent 
threat (APT) campaigns targeting a wide swath 
of industries. Though they appeared unrelated at 
first, further investigation uncovered several key 
links between them: the same malware tools, the 
same elements of code, binaries with the same 
timestamps, and signed binaries with the same 
digital certificates.

Taken together, these commonalities point to 
centralized APT planning and development. How 
prevalent this model has become is unclear. But 
adopting it makes financial sense for attackers, 
so the findings may imply a bigger trend.

This report focuses on two key findings:

• 

Shared development and logistics

•  A shared malware-builder tool

Shared development and logistics 
Examining the 11 APT campaigns revealed a 
shared development and logistics operation used 
to support several APT actors in distinct but 
overlapping campaigns. This development and 
logistics operation is best described as a “digital 
quartermaster.” Its mission: supply and maintain 

malware tools and weapons to support cyber 
espionage. This digital quartermaster also might 
be a cyber arms dealer of sorts, a common 
supplier of tools used to conduct attacks and 
establish footholds in targeted systems.

Shared builder tool 
SFireEye researchers located a builder tool likely 
used in some of the 11 APT campaigns. The tools 
appear to be written in Chinese, and the testing 
infrastructure appears to all be configured with 
the native Chinese language character set, and 
the dialogues and menu options in the builder 
tool are in Chinese.

The Sunshop connection 
In May 2013, FireEye first reported on the 
“Sunshop” campaign, which compromised several 
strategic websites and redirected visitors to a site 
serving multiple exploits.1 In August 2013, 
FireEye reported that the campaign was 
continuing2 and, later that month, discovered 
additional related attacks.

Examining the underlying infrastructure of these 
attacks revealed that the campaign utilized 
resources shared across other APT campaigns 
not initially tied to Sunshop.

The other campaigns included multiyear 
onslaughts targeting companies across 15 
industries. Given the wide range of targets 
observed, the campaigns’ specific objectives 
(beyond the obvious intellectual property theft) 
are unclear.

FireEye detected activity from the campaigns 
between July 2011 and September 2013, but 
they were likely active before then. Though the 
campaigns utilized varying techniques, tactics, 
and procedures (TTPs), they all leveraged a 
common development infrastructure. They 
shared (in various combinations) the following: 

• 

Portable executable resources

•  Digital certificates

•  API import tables

•  Compile times

•  Command-and-control (CnC) infrastructure 

Based on the evidence, this report outlines the 
following possible conclusions:

• 

• 

[High Confidence] A “Sunshop Digital 
Quartermaster” (SDQ) exists and supports 
separate APT campaigns. FireEye believes 
that the most likely explanation for these 
links is a shared development and logistics 
operation that supports several APT 
campaigns as part of formal offensive 
apparatus.

[Low Confidence] SDQ and APT campaigns 
are a single actor. Another conceivable 
possibility is tha the 11 clusters of activity, 
previously believed to be independent 
campaigns run by different actors, are in fact 
one cluster of activity run by one well-
resourced actor. However, we believe this 
scenario is less likely because each cluster of 
activity utilized malware samples with 
different artifacts such as passwords, 
campaign identifiers, and mutexes. These 
artifacts were generally consistent within 
each cluster of activity but differed across 
clusters.

4  Ibid. “The Sunshop Campaign Continues.” August 2013.

• 

[Medium Confidence] SDQ does not exist, 
and APT actors informally share among 
each other. Alternatively, different actors 
may be responsible for the documented 11 
clusters of activity. Instead of relying on a 
centralized development and logistics 
operation, they share TTPs through formal or 
informal channels.

Introduction 
TOn May 20, 2013 FireEye first reported on the 
Sunshop campaign.3 The actor responsible for this 
campaign compromised a number of strategic 
websites, redirecting visitors to a site serving 
multiple exploits. Almost three months later, 
FireEye reported that the campaign was 
continuing.4 We discovered additional related 
attacks about a week after that. During the 
intervening time, we examined the underlying 
infrastructure supporting these attacks and found 
that the Sunshop campaign utilized resources 
shared across a number of other APT campaigns 
not initially tied to Sunshop.

What we initially believed to be 11 different APT 
campaigns used the same malware tools, the same 
elements of code, binaries with the same 
timestamps, and signed binaries with the same 
digital certificates. Through this discovery, we 
believe that we have identified a shared 
development and logistics operation used to 
support a number of different APT actors engaged 
in distinctive but overlapping campaigns. This 
development and logistics operation is best 
described as a digital quartermaster whose mission 
is to supply and maintain malware tools and 
weapons used in support of cyber espionage 
operations. This digital quartermaster is a possible 
cyber arms dealer, supplying the operators 
responsible for conducting attacks and establishing 
footholds within targeted organizations. As such, 
we refer to this entity as the Sunshop Digital 
Quartermaster (SDQ).

To support this conclusion, we first present an 
overview of our research, including the total 
number and type of malicious binaries we found to 
be related to Sunshop and the 10 other linked 
campaigns. We then describe the underlying 
infrastructure, including the components of code 
used across these campaigns. We further describe 
the different clusters of APT activity that we 
previously believed to be unrelated. Finally, we 
describe one of the malware builders we believe 
was used to support one of these clusters of APT 
activity.

Overview
We collected 110 unique binaries, which were 
detected as Trojan.APT.9002, Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy, 
Trojan.APT.Gh0st, Trojan.APT.Kaba, and Trojan.
APT.Briba. Sixty-five of these binaries were 
packaged with two unique manifest resources, and 
47 were signed with six different digital certificates. 
The binaries connected to 54 unique fully qualified 
domains.

Table 1: APT malware samples linked to the SDQ

We identified these samples by searching binaries 
packaged with the two unique portable executable 
(PE) resources that we had previously identified. 
We believe that these PE resources are unique to 
Sunshop and the 10 other linked campaigns.

We also searched for samples signed with the six 
different digital certificates that were used to sign 
binaries connected to these campaigns. These 
certificates were not unique to these campaigns 
and have been used to sign unrelated malware. 
Therefore, we cross-checked samples signed with 
any of these certificates to ensure that they were, in 
fact, related to the 10 campaigns we identified as 
linked to Sunshop.

As we identified related campaigns that leveraged 
the unique PE resources or digital certificates, we 
then pivoted off the CnC infrastructure to identify 
additional samples. We cross-checked samples 
identified through this process to ensure that they 
did indeed share the code elements that we 
previously identified as unique to Sunshop and its 
associated campaigns.

We searched our internal repositories, including 
the FireEye high performance cluster and other 
wellknown external repositories. We primarily 
relied on running active searches with YARA 
signatures designed to identify samples, with either 
the PE resources or digital certificates. We also 
compared the import tables used in each sample to 
establish additional links between the 10 different 
campaigns linked to Sunshop.

All of this research led us to the above-mentioned 
110 binaries. Figure 2 plots the samples in a 
Maltego chart.

Figure 2. Eleven seemingly 
different APT campaigns

Figure 2 shows only domains, IP addresses, and 
MD5 malware/dropper hashes collected during our 
research. These limited data points display 11 
different and seemingly independent clusters of 
activity.

We continued our analysis by adding the following 
additional data points to our graph.

• 

Two portable executable (PE) resources used 
by 64 samples in our collection

• 

Six different digital certificates used by 47 
samples in our collections

•  Hashes of the different import tables used by 

the binaries in our graph

These additional data points linked the 11 different 
clusters of activity and revealed what we believe to 
be a shared development logistics infrastructure.

Figure 3 illustrates the overlaps and connections 
that exist between what initially appeared to be 
11 independent campaigns. This chart shows how 
the additional data points of the shared PE 

resources, commonly used digital certificates, and 
identical import tables can link these different 
campaigns together.

Cluster Analysis Techniques
Our research analyzed the following to identify 
and tie all 11 campaigns to the SDQ:

• 

• 

PE resources

Import tables

•  Authenticode/Digital certificates

•  Compile times

installation system (NSIS). Nullsoft is a script-
driven tool that simplifies the installation routines 
of executable files onto the Microsoft Windows 
operating system.

Sunshop manifest
We identify the first of these manifest resources 
as the “Sunshop manifest.” It has these properties:

MD5       
f9e2887828846b3d383bdf9d0fded5e3

PE resource
We found that 64 of the 110 samples analyzed 
during this analysis were packaged with two 
almost identical portable executable resources. In 
both cases, the resources appeared to be 
manifests generated by the Nullsoft scriptable

We found 44 unique binaries packaged with the 
above Sunshop manifest. These samples were 
detected as Trojan.APT.9002, Trojan.APT.Gh0st, 
and Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy. We observed these 44 
samples used in eight of the 11 different 
campaigns discussed below.

DTL manifest
We identify the second manifest resource as the 
“DTL manifest.” This resource has these properties:

MD5      
010e5a583d74850cdc0655f22c7a9003

Figure 5. DTL PE resource manifest

Figure 6. Comparison of Sunshop (left) and DTL 
(right) PE resource manifests

We found 20 samples using the DTL manifest. 
These binaries were detected as Trojan.APT.9002. 
We observed these 20 samples used in five of the 
11 different campaigns discussed below.

The only difference between these manifest 
resources is the indentation of the <security> 
elements. Lines 10 through 13 in Figure 6 detail 
this difference.

This slight difference results in a different hash for 
the resource. The similarity between these two 
manifests would likely go unnoticed by automated 
analysis. Also, the XML is improperly formatted, 
hinting that it was formatted manually. As an 
experiment, we used NSIS v2.34 to create our 

own simple installer and found that the XML in the 
manifest had no new-line or tab characters.

Import tables
We utilized a simple technique to identify 
similarities in import tables between the 110 
different samples we analyzed during our analysis. 
We aggregated the import calls found in each 
sample and used this as a unique fingerprint. We 
then used these fingerprints to cluster similar 
samples together.

The Python code in Figure 6 relies on the module 
pefile and can be used to dump all the import calls 
used in a specific binary. The output can then be 
easily hashed. 

pe = pefile.PE(file) 
   for entry in pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT: 
      for imp in entry.imports: 
         if imp.name != None: 
            print entry.dll, imp.name, hex(imp.address) 
         else: 
            print entry.dll, hex(imp.address)

calls used in a specific binary

The second most common import table had a 
MD5 hash of 
f6d9eda2b4ab23b1f2be49e1a4f9a1f7 and 
appeared in 12 different samples. These 12 
samples were all detected as Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy 
and appeared in only one of the 10 campaigns 
discussed below. Upon execution, all of the 
malware samples with this import table hash 
beaconed to these domains:

•  luckmegame.servegame[.]com

•  luckmevnc.myvnc[.]com

The third most common import table had a MD5 
hash of 
71213bd677edc82c6ef30cb505c13dec 
and appeared in nine different samples. These 
samples were all detected as Trojan.APT.9002 and 
appeared in three of the 10 campaigns we 
analyzed. Upon execution, these samples called 
back to these domains:

•  engage.intelfox[.]com

•  ru.pad62[.]com

•  tank.hja63[.]com

•  dtl.eatuo[.]com

•  dtl6.mooo[.]com

•  dtl.dnsd[.]me

We found 33 unique import tables used for the 
110 different samples we collected during our 
research. The most common import table seen 
had a MD5 hash of 
3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51 
and appeared in 38 different binaries. This 
particular import table appeared in both Trojan.
APT.9002 and Trojan. APT.PoisonIvy binaries. It 
was used in eight of the 11 different clusters of 
activity we studied during this analysis. In addition 
to the identical import tables, these samples have 
the same code base, differing in the unpacking 
routine for the actual payload, indicating that they 
are general-purpose launchers.

Upon execution, the malware samples with the 
import table hash of 
3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51 
called back to these domains and IP addresses:

Authenticode/digital certificates analysis
Digital certificates are used to validate the 
authenticity of code. Attackers often use stolen or 
spoofed digital certificates to sign their malicious 
code and improve the likelihood that their code 
will execute successfully on its target.

During our research, we found six digital 
certificates used to sign 44 different malware 
samples. These certificates are currently revoked 
or expired and were signed by Microsoft, 
Sinacom, Facesun.cn, Mgame Corp, 
Guangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co., 
Ltd., and Wuhan Tian Chen Information 
Technology Co., Ltd. The full details of 
these certificates are available in Appendix A. 
According to Kaspersky, the Mgame Corp. and 
Guangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co., 
Ltd. certificates were stolen.5 Whether the 
remaining certificates were also stolen—or were 
ever valid—is unclear.

The certificates from Mgame Corp and Wuhan 
Tian Chen Information Technology 
Co. ,Ltd. were used most frequently. We 
found 24 samples signed with the certificate from 
Mgame Corp. These samples were all detected 
as Trojan.APT.9002 and appeared in four of the 10 
campaigns we studied during this research.

We found 15 samples signed with the certificate 
from Wuhan Tian Chen Information 
Technology Co., Ltd. These samples were 
all detected as Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy and appeared 
in one of the 10 campaigns discussed below.

Compile times
Although the compilation time of binaries can be 
easily forged, analyzing them is still useful. The 
timestamp may not reveal when a binary was 
actually compiled, but it can be used to cluster 
samples by identical compile times.

The most common compile time was December 
19, 2012 at 20:25. We found 28 binaries compiled 
at this time. All of these binaries were detected as 
Trojan.APT.9002 and utilized the Sunshop PE 
resource. We observed samples with this 
timestamp in six of the 11 clusters of APT activity 
we studied during this research.

The next most common compile time was July 21, 
2012 at 14:50. We identified five samples 
compiled at this time. All of these samples were 
detected as Trojan.APT.9002 and utilized the DTL 
PE resource. These samples appeared in two of 
the 11 campaigns.

The use of this same compile times across a 
number of different campaigns is another 
indication that a common development and 
logistics infrastructure supported these disparate 
operations.

Clusters
The shared characteristics were used across 
malware tools used in at least 11 different clusters 
of APT activity. These clusters were originally 
believed to be separate and distinct campaigns 
and were grouped together based on shared CnC 
infrastructure using passive DNS data or 
registration information.

Cluster 1: Sunshop 
The Sunshop campaign appears to primarily 
leverage strategic Web compromise as a vector of 
attack. We have detailed the specifics of the 
Sunshop campaign on the FireEye blog.6 We found 
15 different samples linked to the Sunshop 
campaign. These samples were detected as Trojan.
APT.Gh0st, Trojan. APT.PoisonIvy, Trojan.APT.
Briba, and Trojan.APT.9002. All of the Sunshop 
samples that we identified had compile times 
between January 1, 2013 and August 24, 2013. 
Twelve of the 15 utilized the Sunshop PE

Cluster 2: DTL 
The DTL campaign appears to depend primarily on 
spear-phishing email as an initial infection vector. 
We found seven different samples linked to the 
DTL campaign. All of these samples were detected 
as Trojan.APT.9002. These samples were 
compiled between September 19, 2012 and July 
30, 2013. All of these samples were packaged 
with the DTL PE resource, and one of the samples 
was signed with the digital certificate from 
Mgame Corp.

Cluster 3: Ru.pad62 
The Ru.pad62 campaign appears to utilize both 
spear-phishing email and strategic Web 
compromise as initial infection vectors. We found 
26 different samples linked to the Ru.pad62 
campaign. These samples were detected as Trojan.
APT.9002, Trojan.APT.Gh0st, Trojan.APT.Kaba, 
and Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy. The 26 linked samples 
had compile timestamps between September 19, 
2011 and December 19, 2012. Ten of the samples 
from the Ru.pad62 campaign were packaged with 
the DTL resource, and six of the samples were 
packaged with the Sunshop resource. Only four 
samples linked to the Ru.pad62 campaign were 
signed with digital certificates—two with the 
Mgame Corp. certificate and two with a 
certificate from Microsoft.

Cluster 4: Downmicrisoft 
The Downmicrisoft campaign appears to utilize 
strategic Web compromise as an initial infection 
vector. We found five different samples linked to 
the Downmicrisoft campaign. These samples were 
detected as Trojan.APT.9002 and Trojan.APT.
Gh0st. The five samples had compile timestamps 
between December 19, 2012 and April 4, 2013. 
The earliest compile time for samples from the 
Downmicrisoft campaign (December 19, 2012) 
was the same day as the latest compile time for 
samples from the Ru.Pad62 campaign. Three of 
the samples linked to the Downmicrisoft campaign 
were packaged with the Sunshop PE resource, and 
all but one sample was signed with the Mgame 
Corp. digital certificate.

Cluster 5: Boeing-Job 
The Boeing-Job campaign appears to utilize 
strategic Web compromises as an initial infection 
vector. We previously discussed the Boeing-Job 
campaign’s use of the “Lady Boyle” Flash exploit on 
the FireEye blog.8 We identified 19 different 
samples linked to the Boeing-Job campaign. These 
samples were all detected as Trojan.APT.9002 and 
had compile timestamps between July 21, 2012

Cluster 10: Packets 
The Packets campaign appears to utilize spear-
phishing email as an initial infection vector. We 
identified one Trojan.APT.9002 sample linked to 
the Packets campaign. This sample had a compile 
time of December 19, 2012 and was packaged 
with the Sunshop PE resource. The sample was 
not signed with a digital certificate. It called back 
to this CnC server:

Cluster 11: Allshell 
The Allshell campaign appears to utilize spear-
phishing email as a vector to attack its targets. We 
identified one Trojan.APT.9002 sample linked to 
the Allshell campaign. This sample had a compile 
time of October 16, 2012 and was packaged with 
the DTL PE resource. The sample was not signed 
with a digital certificate. It called back to this CnC 
server:

•  mlog.ddns[.]us

•  stmp.allshell[.]net

The campaign targeted these industries:

•  High-tech

•  Aerospace/Defense/Airlines

To recap, these shared characteristics, as 
discussed in previous sections, include the 
following:

• 

The Sunshop and DTL PE resources

•  Common import tables

• 

Six different digital certificates

•  Common compile times

•  Common malware families

Shared Builders
These observed shared characteristics across 
these malware samples are likely the result of a 
set of common “builders” developed by a shared 
development and logistics infrastructure.

Builders are tools used by malicious actors to 
quickly and easily create different variants of the 
same malware. In a typical scenario, a skilled 
developer creates a builder and shares it with an 
operator more skilled in intrusion operations than 
in code development. This separation of tasks is 
more efficient and supports a faster tempo of 
offensive operations. A typical builder provides a 
graphical user interface that enables a threat 
actor to configure elements such as the location of 
the CnC server.

Figure 9: Typical Builder life cycle

We identified a builder tool used to create Trojan.APT.9002 binaries, which we are dubbing “9002 
Builder.” This builder generates Trojan.APT.9002 binaries with the DTL resource.

Figure 10: Builder used to generate 
Trojan.APT.9002 malware

As shown in Figure 10, the dialogue and menu 
options in this GUI are in Chinese. The builder 
enables threat actors to configure the following:

• 

Proxy settings, including address/port, type, 
proxy authentication details, auto-detect 
proxy, and force-proxy only.

•  Both a primary and a secondary CnC server.

•  A specific ID. The default ID produced by this 

builder is “1.”

•  An “Internet health check” domain. The 

default health check domain configured in 
this builder was “update.microsoft.com”. An 
Internet health check domain is typically used 
by malware to determine whether a target’s 
endpoint is connected to the Internet before 
acting.

Also, the text in the title bar of this builder is 
“[User_Server_Builder] update 2012-7-21”. 
Although the servers produced by this builder 
have a compile time of 10/23/12 8:30 UTC, we 
believe the date in the title bar of the builder is 
significant; we identified five different binaries 
with a compile time of 7/21/12.

All five utilized the same DTL resource found in 
9002 Builder.

Table 13: Malware samples created by a builder using 
the same DTL resource found in 9002 Builder

The 9002 Builder appears to be a modified variant 
of the builder used to create the samples listed in 
Table 12. The compile time of the builder is 
10/23/2012 11:18 UTC, a little less than 3 hours 
after the compile time of the server that is 
produced by it. We believe it is a common practice 
for the developer to compile a new server, update 
the builder code accordingly, then compile the 
new builder. The older date in the title bar may 
just be an oversight as i t would have to be 
manually updated by the developer.

The builder contains a copy of the server 
executable in its PE resource section, under BIN. 
The server executable is responsible for installing 
the 9002 payload malware, and has its 
configuration block stored in its .data section, 
with some default settings including the CnC 
pointing to 192.168.8.105. The configuration 
block uses simple, single-byte XOR encryption. 
The key varies from version to version; in some 
cases, it skips null bytes. During the installation 
routine, the configuration block is written to the 
registry value sysinfo under the registry key 
HKCU\Software\Classes.

before (left) and after (right) XOR decryption

When the threat actor builds a malware 
executable, the builder writes the server 
executable to disk and overwrites the 
configuration block with the newly configured 
options. The location of the configuration block 
within the .data section is hard-coded, meaning 
that the builder must be modified each time the 
server code is updated and the location of the 
configuration block changes. We noticed that the 
configuration block is indeed stored at a different 
offset in the samples compiled on 7/21/12 as 
compared to the sample created by the builder 
we have with the compile date of 10/23/12. This 
further supports our belief in the practice of the 
developer compiling the server and then shortly 
after compiling the builder. He would need time 
to locate the new offset of the configuration 
block in the newly compiled server executable 

and then change the hard-coded value in the 
builder code.

Attackers using 9002 Builder seem to have 
gradually adopted another launcher that stores 
the configuration block as a resource instead of 
storing it in its .data section. Based on the 
compile-time analysis outlined in the “Compile 
Times” section of this report, the shift began in 
late October of 2012 (with a few exceptions). This 
shift makes sense for the builder’s developer(s); 
they no longer needed to update the builder for 
every code change in the launcher or 9002 
payload malware. This launcher, mentioned earlier 
in this paper as having the import table hash 
3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51, 
supports different payloads, such as Poison Ivy 
and 9002.

Conclusion
Based on the evidence provided, we draw the 
following possible conclusions:

[High Confidence] SDQ exists and supports 
separate APT campaigns. We believe the most 
likely explanation for these documented 
correlations is that a shared ‘development and 
logistics’ operation (SDQ) supports a number of 
different APT campaigns, as part of formal 
offensive apparatus.

[Low Confidence] SDQ and APT campaigns are 
a single actor. That said, it is conceivable that the 
11 clusters of activity, previously believed to be 
independent campaigns run by different actors, 
are in fact one cluster of activity run by one 
well-resourced actor. However, we believe this 
scenario is less likely because each cluster of 
activity utilized malware samples with different 
artifacts such as passwords, campaign identifiers, 
and mutexes. These artifacts were generally 
consistent within each cluster of activity but 
differed across clusters.

[Medium Confidence] SDQ does not exist, and 
APT actors informally share among each other. 
Alternatively, different actors might be 
responsible for the documented 11 clusters of 
activity and instead of relying on a centralized 
development and logistics operation, these 
actors share TTPs through formal or informal 
channels.

In each of these scenarios, a shared development 
and logistics infrastructure or some notion of a 
digital quartermaster clearly underpins all of the 
activity presented in this report. Whether this 
quartermaster involves informal connections 
between developers or a structured bureaucratic 
organization serving a central offensive 
apparatus is unclear. Regardless of the scenario, 
the overall finding of a shared development and 
logistics infrastructure suggests targeted 
organizations are facing a more organized 
menace than they realize.

About FireEye
FireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual 
machine-based security platform that provides 
real-time threat protection to enterprises and 
governments worldwide against the next 
generation of cyber attacks. These highly 
sophisticated cyber attacks easily circumvent 
traditional signature-based defenses, such as 
next-generation firewalls, IPS, anti-virus, and 
gateways. The FireEye Threat Prevention 
Platform provides real-time, dynamic threat 

protection without the use of signatures to 
protect an organization across the primary threat 
vectors, including mobile, Web, email, and files and 
across the different stages of an attack life cycle. 
The core of the FireEye platform is a virtual 
execution engine, complemented by dynamic 
threat intelligence, to identify and block cyber 
attacks in real time. FireEye has over 1,100 
customers across more than 40 countries, 
including over 100 of the Fortune 500.
