Executive Summary 

In the past thirty days (30) an increase attack activity has been observed using the "njRAT" 
malware. This remote access trojan (RAT) has capabilities to log keystrokes, access the victim's 
camera, steal credentials stored in browsers, open a reverse shell, upload/download files, view 
the victim's desktop, perform process, file, and registry manipulations, and capabilities to let the 
attacker update, uninstall, restart, close, disconnect the RAT and rename its campaign ID. 
Through the Command & Control (CnC) server software, the attacker has capabilities to create 
and configure the malware to spread through USB drives.  

"njRAT" is currently leveraged by advanced threat actors in the Middle East, in particular when 
delivered via HTTP (i.e. Phishing attack or Drive-by download). It has also been observed that 
attackers are delivering "njRAT" embedded in other applications (i.e. L517 v.0.994 Word List 
Generator), and compressed with EZIRIZ .NET Reactor/.NET protector. Obfuscation with the use 
of compressors or protectors is a technique used by attackers to prevent detection by network-
based and host-based security defenses. 

We have observed the majority of the attacks leveraging "njRAT" to be against organizations 
based in or focused on the Middle East region in the government, telecom, and energy sectors. 
However as this is a publicly available tool it can be attained and deployed with ease regardless 
of location or industry.  

During the analysis of "njRAT", it was observed that some of the top antivirus vendors were not 
currently detecting some variants of this threat.  

Some of the file names of carrier files or njRAT samples observed were: L517 v0.994.exe, 
RealUpgrade.exe, password hotmail cracker 2013.exe, elisa.exe, Crack All Games.exe, fresh cc

This document will provide detailed information about the njRAT's functionality, file system 
indicators, network indicators, some of the campaign IDs observed,  MD5 hashes, and domains. 
It will also go over a detailed analysis of one of the malware variants. 

Threat Overview 

 

www.fidelissecurity.com 
www.threatgeek.com
 @FidSecSys 
+1800.652.4020   

The "njRAT" is a robust remote access trojan that once it reaches and infects the end-point, 
allows the attacker to have full control over the Victim system. With this access, the attacker can 
start scanning other systems in the victim network to perform lateral movement.   

We will start this section by performing analysis on the following "njRAT" sample:  

-  Filename:  
-  MD5:  

 

Authorization.exe 
1d3baedd747f6f9bf92c81eb9f63b34b 

The "Authorization.exe" njRAT malware was embedded and dropped in the victim system by the 
following file: "Authorization form may - 2013 - 115444.scr" (MD5: 
63781fe1932e612c6c29225d25515111). 

The next section (Indicators & Mitigation Strategies), will provide information about other variants 
of the malware obtained.  

Summary 

 
The "Authorization.exe" malware sample was created with version V.0.5 of this RAT. The 
njRAT application was developed with VB.NET (Visual Basic .NET). 

When the malware connects to the Command & Control (CnC) server, the attacker is able to 
perform the following actions from the njRAT CnC server GUI:  

-  Open a 'File Manager' window to manipulate files 

o  This window allows the attacker to Upload & Download, Run, Delete, Edit, 

Rename, Copy, Cut, Paste, and Empty files. 

o  The window also allows the attacks to create new folders in the Victim system 

-  Open a 'Run File' window 

o  This window allows the attacker to upload a file, or provide a link to a file to run in 

the Victim system 

-  Open a 'Remote Desktop' window 

o  When selected, it opens a live window of the Victim's user desktop 

-  Open a 'Remote Cam' window 

o  This window allows the attacker to obtain access to the Victim's system camera 

to see the Victim user

-  Open a 'Registry' window  

delete, create keys and values) 

-  Open a 'Keylogger' window 

o  This window allows the attacker manipulate the Victim's system registry (edit, 

-  Open a 'Remote Shell' window 

o  This window opens a reverse shell window and allow the attacker to perform all 

the activities possible from the command prompt  

-  Open a 'Process Manager' window 

o  This window allows the attacker to Refresh the process list, Kill processes, 

o  When this option is selected, the keylogger file is automatically uploaded from 

the Victim system into the attacker's machine 

-  Open a 'Get Passwords' window 

o  This window appears to collect all the passwords stored by the browser (User, 

Password, URL, App). At the moment of writing this report, the functionality was 
not confirmed. When the option is selected, the malware searches Mozilla 
Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera directories. 

-  Open a 'Server' window 

o  This window allows the attacker to Update, Uninstall, Restart, Close, Disconnect, 

or Rename the malware running in the Victim system 

-  Open an 'Open Folder' window 

o  This window open the local folder in the attackers machine in which the artifacts 

collected through the "njRAT" GUI are stored in his/her system 

-  Open a 'Builder' Window 

o  This window allows the attacker to build new Clients to be deployed to Victims or 
used in attack campaigns. Some of the options in this builders allows the attacker 
to configure: 
 
  C2 node IP 
  C2 node port 
  Vic Tim Name (Looks like this could be used to identify the attack campaign) 
  Malware name (when it makes a copies itself) 
  Directory to make a copy of the malware when it is executed 
  Capabilities to spread via USB 
  Select the malware icon 
  Protect the malware process 
  Stub Randomization

The "Authorization.exe" malware has keylogger functionality. It stores the logged keystrokes 
in the following file: "[CWD]\.tmp". When the malware is dropped by the "Authorization form 
may - 2013 - 115444.scr" carrier file, the logged keystrokes are stored in: 
"C:\Extracted\.tmp". 

The IP address used by the Command & Control (C2) node appears to be under an IP range 
owned by: "Palestinian Internet Services, P. O. BOX 5111 Gaza City, Palestine".  

Variants of this malware have been observed by the community since at least 2012. The 
malware appears to be known by the community as: njRAT, MSIL/Bladabindi, and 
Backdoor.LV.  

 
When the "Authorization.exe" malware is executed it: 

-  Creates a copy of itself in the following locations: 

o  %APPDATA%\msnco.exe 
o  C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Start 

Menu\Programs\Startup\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe 

 

-  Tries to open the following file: [CWD]\ Authorization.exe.config 

 

-  Entrenches in the system for persistence in the following registry locations: 

o  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ru

n\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10

o  Value: [%APPDATA%]\msnco.exe:*:Enabled:msnco.exe 
 

-  Beacons to the following C2 node over TCP port 1177: "217.66.231.245" 

 

The attacker tries to make sure the malware will run in the system by making the second 
copy into the above mentioned directory (C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe) 

 
o  This causes the malware to execute again when the system is rebooted and re-starts 
the infection in the system. Once the system is infected again, it will beacon to the C2 
node. 

The attacker tries to trick the user by using different icons for the malware. Various samples 
were observed with MS Word and PDF icons. The following is a screenshot of how the file 
will look like to a normal user: 

When the system is configured to show file extensions, the EXE extension is now revealed: 

 

When the malware connects to the C2 node, it will send information about the victim system, 
malware version, open windows, etc. The following is the network traffic observed:

Base64 encoded data. The decoded data reveals the following string: 
"Nw_C4264EBB". It appears that the string before the "_" (Nw) can be used by the 
attacker to identify the attack campaign. This is configured through the "njRAT"

Base64 encoded data. The decoded data reveals the following string: 
"cptbt_Process_Registry_File_Info.log - Notepad". In this case, the decoded string 
is just information about an open window used by the examiner to capture system 
activity 

 
Information sent by the attacker on opened windows in the system could inform him/her of his 
malware being analyzed and allowed to connect to the C2 node. For example, if Wireshark, 
Filemon, Regmon, and IDA are opened in the system when the analyst executes the 
malware, this will quickly let the attacker know that someone is performing reverse 
engineering of his malicious code.

Table 2: MD5 hash, File system artifacts 

 

 
Note: The copy of njRAT created with the filename "Trojan.exe", is the default filename string in 
the njRAT Builder interface. The Keylogger file location referred to as "[CWD]\.tmp", refers to 
the location from which the original malware is executed. It was observed that this was used 
when the malware was embedded in a legitimate looking application, and the kelogger files 
get created in the directory of that application (i.e. C:\Program 
Files\Facebook\QuadAtom\.tmp).

The following will present the network traffic observed when different options were selected from 
the "njRAT" C2 server GUI (YELLOW = Data sent by C2. TURQUOISE = Response from Victim). 
These artifacts will hopefully assist the research community with generation of network signatures 
to detect this threat: 

-  File Manager window  

 
In this case, the "C:\" directory of the Victim system was browsed and a folder named 
"njRAT_Directory_Created" was created in it.

The Fidelis Take 

Fidelis XPS sensors detect the "njRAT" malware variants and domains observed throughout this 
report.    

Fidelis XPS sensors detected the NJC242.exe/njRAT malware as "Trojan.Win32.Jorik.Agent.rkp". 
Fidelis XPS is capable of detecting this threat regardless of delivery method employed by the 
Threat Actors responsible. Fidelis XPS can detect and alert on executables such as the "njRAT" 
malware multiple layers deep inside of archive files (i.e. ZIP), or even XOR'ed inside of a 
weaponized MS Office document or Adobe PDF File. The Fidelis Threat Research and Network 
Forensics and Incident Response teams will continue to actively monitor the ever-evolving threat 
landscape for the latest threats to our customers’ network security.
